Internet Technology <small>with J. Francisco</small>
====================================================

Description
-----------

To provide a practical understanding of computer networks with respect to 
system architectures, protocols, and client-server interaction.  
These objectives are accomplished through extensive laboratory exercises.

### Topics

-   Communication media; 
    -   protocol layers, 
    -   TCP/IP protocols, 
    -   wireless protocols, 
    -   high speed protocols, 
    -   routing, 
    -   and switching architectures.

-   Interprocess communication, 
-   client-server interaction, 
-   and socket programming.
-   Emerging trends and technologies such as:
    -   high speed asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) communication, 
    -   wireless communication, 
    -   and videoconferencing.

### Department Learning Goals

-   Computer Science majors ...
    -   will be prepared to contribute to a rapidly changing field 
        by acquiring a thorough grounding in the core principles and 
        foundations of computer science (e.g., techniques of program design, 
        creation, and testing; key aspects of computer hardware; 
        algorithmic principles).
    -   will acquire a deeper understanding on (elective) topics of more 
        specialized interest, and be able to critically review, 
        assess, and communicate current developments in the field.
    -   will be prepared for the next step in their careers, for example,
        by having done a research project (for those headed to graduate 
        school), a programming project (for those going into the software 
        industry), or some sort of business plan (for those going into 
        startups).
