Principle of Programming Languages <small>with Professor Louis Steinberg</small>
================================================================================

Description
-----------

The course is aimed at making the student familiar with the general concepts common to all programming languages so as to facilitate learning new languages.  Language paradigms (i.e., logic, functional, procedural, object-oriented) are compared and implementation strategies are discussed.

-   Credits: 4
-   Prerequisites:
    -   14:332:331 or 01:198:211; 
    -   01:198:205 or 14:332:312.

-   Please note that courses for which a student has received a grade of D cannot be used to satisfy prerequisite requirements.
-   Semesters Offered: Spring and fall

### Topics

-   BNF and context free grammars; Data visibility (i.e., lexical and dynamic scoping); 
-   Procedures and  parameter passing techniques; 
-   Types, type checking and type equivalence; 
-   Functional programming paradigm:
    -   higher-order functions, 
    -   recursive data structures, 
    -   programming with recursion (i.e., without iteration);  

-   Logic programming paradigm:  
    -   unification, generate and test;  
    -   Programming with pointers in C.

### Expected Work

There are three graded programming projects and textbook homework assignments.

-   Exams:
    -   1 hourly, Final Exam

### Department Learning Goals

-   Computer Science majors ...
    -   will be prepared to contribute to a rapidly changing field by acquiring a thorough grounding in the core principles and foundations of computer science (e.g., techniques of program design, creation, and testing; key aspects of computer hardware; algorithmic principles).
    -   will acquire a deeper understanding on (elective) topics of more specialized interest, and be able to critically review, assess, and communicate current developments in the field.
    -   will be prepared for the next step in their careers, for example, by having done a research project (for those headed to graduate school), a programming project (for those going into the software industry), or some sort of business plan (for those going into startups).

Syllabus
--------

### Objective

-   Primary objective: Learn new ways of thinking about problems and programs.
-   Secondary objective: Make it easier to learn new languages by learning principles that apply to many languages.
-   Tertiary objective: Learn some interesting languages.

### Prerequisite

-   CS 205, CS 211
-   Java; the memory model of C, including pointers; predicate calculus

### Book

-   Michael L. Scott, Programming Language Pragmatics, 3rd Edition. Morgan Kaufman

**The textbook does not cover all of the material for this course, 
and is not a substitute for attending class.**

### Work

-   You are expected to attend all lectures and recitations, in both body and mind. That is, please do not access Facebook, games, email, or the like during class.
-   There will be two midterms exams and a final, as well as graded programing projects and ungraded exercises. The projects only count for a small part of your grade directly, because there is no way to be sure that they are really your own work. However, they count for a large part of your grade indirectly. If you do not do the exercises and projects you will not learn the material. Furthermore, there will be exam questions directly based on the projects and exercises.

### Tentative Grading

Your course grade is based on projects and exams, with the following tentative weighting:

-   Projects (all together): 10%
-   Midterm 1: 25%
-   Midterm 2: 25%
-   Final exam: 40%

### Course grades

Your course grade will be computed as follows: Each score (for each exam and each project) will be converted to a percentage score, and the percentages will be added, with weights as above. Cutoffs for letter grades are:

-   A: 90%
-   B+: 85%
-   B: 80%
-   C+: 75%
-   C: 70%
-   D: 60%

### Grading disputes

If you feel an exam or a project has been misgraded, you must bring it to our attention within 2 weeks of when we first give back the graded exam or project.

### Collaboration

All students in this class are expected to be familiar with the The DCS academic integrity policy, which can be found at http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/policies/academicintegrity/ , and to abide by it.

We do encourage you to us the Piazza site to discuss the concepts behind course material and assignments, but please do not post code. If you need help with code, email it to the professor or a TA.

### Exams

Exam schedules and rules are in Resources > Exam info. You are expected to know and to abide by these rules.

### Poor grades

If you get less than 70% on an exam please contact the 314 TA's or instructor immediately. Often students wait until after the final, and then ask how they can raise their grade. At that point there is no way to raise their grade. The earlier you contact us the more chance we can be of help.
