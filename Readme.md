Philosophy
----------

### Topics in Social and Political Philosophy, Fall 2012 with Professor Mark Colby

This seminar explores in depth two of the seminal writings of John Stuart Mill (1806-1873). We begin with Utilitarianism (final version, 1863), his major work in ethical theory and the foundation of his philosophy on ethical, social, and political matters. Then we analyze On Liberty (1859), his most famous and influential work, containing the core of his normative vision of human well-being, especially its social, political, and epistemic dimensions. The lectures will also discuss some of the principles of his Considerations on Representative Government (1860), via handouts. The primary topics of the course are Mill’s theory of value; his developmental conception of human nature; his utilitarian synthesis of Aristotle’s virtue theory and Kant’s rights-based theory of morality; his epistemology or theory of the nature of truth, including his account of intellectual and historical progress; his liberal theory of individuality and autonomy; and his theories of politics, justice, and government.

### Leibniz, Spring 2013 with Professor Martha Bolton

The course is intended to provide a good understanding of some of the
central doctrines of Leibniz's metaphysics and theory of cognition, the
reasoning by which we supports them, their strengths and weakness,
historical context and significance. It is also meant to develop skill
in analyzing and evaluating arguments, as well as developing,
supporting, and expressing views of one's own.

### Aristotle, Spring 2013 with Professor Robert Bolton

The aim of the course is to understand the relation between Aristotle's epistemology
and his cognitive psychology, particularly concerning perception.
