------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Concepts and Questions of Epistemology

-   Epistemology is the study of knowledge and related phenomena.
-   Why is this important?
    -   It can lead to better decisions.

-   How do we get truths? **Justification**.
    -   A justified or warranted belief is more likely to be true.
    -   A randomly or haphazardly chosen belief is less likely to be
        true.
    -   So how do we get the first?

-   What is a belief (alternatively opinion?)
    -   It is a *psychological attitude towards a proposition*.
        -   Where a proposition is (roughly) content which purports to
            be fact.

    -   To believe is to *mentally assent* to a propositions.
    -   Possible doxastic attitudes:
        1.  **Belief**, to mentally assent.
        2.  **Disbelief**, to mentally dissent.
        3.  **Suspension**, to neither assent nor dissent.

> It is widely thought that forming a belief that is reasonable,
> warranted, or justified is the best means available of forming a true
> belief

-   Epistemic evaluations are different from moral evaluations.
    -   They express evaluations on an *intellectual dimension*.

-   Truth and justification are not equivalent.
    -   Truth is purely metaphysical.
    -   It is true or false *of the world*.
    -   You can have a justified false belief.

-   Justification is one form of epsitemic evaluation, but perhaps there
    are others.
    -   For instance, rationality may be another, unique or not.

-   Some points of widespread agreement:
    1.  Knowledge implies truth;
    2.  A person must believe p, or have reasonably high credence in p,
        in order to know it;
    3.  Knowledge requires justification.

### The Epistemic Regress Problem

-   Many sources of justification are inference.
-   Justification needn't be spoken.
-   The structure of justification is a tree, where properly justified
    beliefs (nodes) inherit justification from roots
    -   With roots in truth?

-   Where does the original justification come from?
    -   This is the **regress problem**.

-   Possible solutions:
    -   **Infinitism**: An unending continuation of reasons, without
        repetition or end.  
    -   **Foundationalism**: An ending tree of reasons.
    -   **Coherentism**: A tree that loops back on itself.
    -   **Skepticism**. None of the first three solutions to the regress
        problem is satisfactory.

-   There are two types of ways of looking at justification with regards
    to time.
    -   **Synchronic**: A synchronic reason for a belief happens at the
        same time as the target belief.
    -   **Diachronic**: A diachronic reason is unavailable at the
        formation of the target belief?

### Infinitism

> Infinitism is rarely given serious consideration.

-   If justification goes back infinitely far, then we hold infinitely
    many beliefs?
    -   No human person has infinitely many beliefs.

-   Perhaps justification needn't originate anywhere.
-   What about with regards to people holding infinitely many beliefs?
    -   **Doxastic justification** is a property of existing beliefs.
    -   **Propositional justification** arises from the state or
        condition of an epistemic agent that entitles her to believe a
        proposition.

> infinitism can be interpreted as the view that there are infinitely
> many propositions (rather than beliefs) that form chains of
> inferential justification.

-   This may support foundationalism, however, because if justification
    isn't (ultimately) a doxastic attitude, then there is an end to the
    held beliefs which can serve an agent.
    -   There is no way that infinitist ghost propositions can be
        measured without making the propositions becoming beliefs.

-   "Justification is limited in RAM, unlimited in HDD storage."

### Coherentism

-   Coherentism is a minority view today, but historically important.
    -   Largely, the view *tolerates circular inference*.
    -   "Sometimes circularity is okay."

-   There are no "privileged beliefs" that are tethered to truth, but
    rather any net of self-supporting justification are valid
    epistemologically.
    -   "Justification is a circularly linked list."

-   Coherence and justifiedness are not intimately linked at all, and
    coherence and truth are similarly unlinked (thought not for the same
    reasons, justification and truth are distinct).

### Foundationalism and Basic Beliefs

> Foundationalism’s response to the regress problem says that every root
> in a tree of (successful) inferential justification terminates after
> finitely many steps.

-   Foundational beliefs have two crucial properties:
    -   The are *uninferred*;
    -   They are justified.

-   There are four questions that foundationalism must address to
    succeed:
    1.  Exactly what does it take for a belief to attain the status of
        "justified" in an unmediated or non-inferential fashion? What
        must take place or hold true of a belief to confer on it the
        property of being immediately justified?
    2.  Which types of belief or families of belief qualify as
        immediately justified? What kinds of propositional contents lend
        themselves to immediate justification?
    3.  What strength of justification do immediately justified beliefs
        need to attain according to foundationalism? Must basic beliefs
        exhibit the highest grade of justification, i.e., certainty,
        infallibility, or incorrigibility? Or can basic beliefs have
        weaker degrees of justification while still being basic?
    4.  Assuming that many immediately justified beliefs are available,
        does this enable epistemic agents to draw enough reasonable
        inferences that they can attain a large corpus of justified
        beliefs (both basic and non-basic), enough to dispel the specter
        of skepticism that is often laid at foundationalism's doorstep?

### Concepts and Questions

-   Doxastic attitudes, "Epistemic terms of appraisal"
    -   Beliefs, non-belief,
    -   Tripartite approach.
    -   What are others?
        -   Degrees of conviction
        -   "High confidence", expresses a doxastic attitude, on a range
            of attitudes.

    -   It's not like desiring, or hating.
        -   It's an attitude about truth or falsity.
        -   An "intellectual" attitude.
        -   Abstaining from being committal.

-   Are beliefs epistemic states?
    -   Lots of philosophers talk about beliefs as epistemic states.
        -   Doxastic attitudes are psychological states.
        -   Epistemic states are evaluations on intellectual dimensions.

-   "Know" is traditionally thought not to be an entirely mental state.
    -   It's partly:
        -   Having a belief.
        -   Having a justified belief.
        -   And being true.

    -   Knowledge is a "mental state plus …"
        -   Something like justification
        -   An epistemic component.

-   We never want to mix up truth and justification.
    -   Justification is limited to an epistemic or doxastic agent.
    -   Justified *for whom*?
    -   Justified *when*?

-   "You're justified in believing, but you don't."
    -   Propositional justification.

-   "You're justified in believing, and you do."

### The Regress Problem

-   An inferential regress.
-   To give a reason is to say something.
    -   You might have a reason, but not say it.

-   The skeptic thesis:
    -   We do not have as many JTBs as we think we do commonsensically.

-   If you say we're talking about doxastic justification, then yes,
    maybe we cannot have infinitely many psychological states.
    -   "Propositional justifiedness"

### Coherentism

-   Was popular in idealism (one or another) in Britain and American
    dominant.
    -   These involved people that are not read anymore.
    -   Royce, Bradley.
    -   Late 19th century.
    -   Very popular
    -   They often talk about in the kind of abstract way that
        infinitism will be defended.
    -   The methodology was much more abstract.

-   There are senses within belief.
    -   The belief *itself*, the psychological action.
    -   The belief's *content*, the proposition believed.

-   We want to distinguish between saying that "*p* is justified" and
    "*p* is justified for *S* at time *t*."
    -   The second one is okay and is precise.
    -   The first is not useful in epistemology.
    -   Propositions do not do any justification of their own,
        propositions are not justified.
        -   Beliefs *in* propositions *by* agents are justified *for
            them*.
        -   You do not get anything from propositional coherence.

-   What's the relationship between rationality and justification.
    -   There's no common practice.

-   Can coherence account for non-coherent justified beliefs?

### Foundationalism

-   Descartes thought that "basic beliefs" (new terminology) are about
    the agent's mental states.
-   Well what are basic/immediate beliefs like?
    -   Early on, beliefs about mental states.
    -   Later, beliefs from perception.

September 16th, 2013 <small>Chapter 2, part I, 'Evidentialism vs. Reliabilism'</small>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **justifier** refers to anything that helps make a belief state
    justified or unjustified.
    -   Anything that contributes to the **justificational status** of a
        target belief.

> How can one legitimately infer outward (to the external world),
> forward (to the future), and backward (to the past) from the
> indicated, very limited, data-set?

-   **Evidentialism**: all (positive or negative) justifiers of a belief
    held by epistemic agent *S* at time *t* are evidential states *S* is
    in at *t*.
    -   there must be a relation of **fittingness** that holds between
        the attitude of belief (directed at *P*) and *S*’s total
        evidential states at *t*.
    -   *X* is evidence for *Y* just in case possessing *X* enhances a
        person’s justification for believing *Y*.

> what justifies me in thinking that the fusiform gyrus of my right
> occipital cortex is being activated is that the fusiform gyrus of my
> right occipital cortex is being activated

-   **Reliablism**: Belief *B* is justified if and only *B* is produced
    by a reliable belief-forming process, i.e., a process that has a
    tendency to generate (belief) outputs with a high percentage of
    truths.

### Questions

1.  pg. 4, "According to evidentialism, all (positive or negative)
    justifiers of a belief held by epistemic agent S at time t are
    evidential states S is in at t." This took a few reads and a
    cross-check with the Wikipedia to fully understand. Specifically, I
    didn't know what it meant for S to be "in an evidential state." When
    I worked out what that meant, the definition was easily understood.
    -   This was supremely cleared up on pg. 7, with the precise
        formulation of evidentialism, what it implies.

2.  pg. 10, "Nonetheless, it is perfectly plausible that her belief in
    this proposition is justified." This actually happens all the time!
    It may add something to the credibility and plausibility of the case
    to name the psychology term for it: Source Amnesia.
    -   pg. 11, "it plays no causal role in her current belief in D." I
        cannot find anything defined with that variable, thought I think
        I can reasonably assume it's the claim about the earth.

3.  pg. 18, "Thus, wishful thinking is “bad” because the beliefs it
    outputs are only occasionally true." Wouldn't wishful thinking still
    be bad even if the beliefs it outputs were more often than not true?
    It's not clear to me from the example wishful think is bad because
    of unreliability, but it is certainly unreliable.
    -   pg. 18, "The overextended version of disjunctive syllogism is
        “bad” because it would frequently lead to erroneous conclusions
        even when the inputs to it are true." This is closer to my
        intuition, but all it would take for me to think that it was bad
        was one case where even one invalid logical schema was used. A
        good schema is always gets good conclusions for when the inputs
        are true.
    -   After I read the definition for process reliablism a bit further
        down along with the suitably vague portion, it seems very
        plausible for longer belief forming processes like perception
        (which is vague, which has variable successes and failures), but
        not so applicable to using bad logic rules. I think the
        difference is that a bad logic schema has concrete, knowable
        cases of when it always gets it wrong.
    -   After (CR) and (UR), this was cleared up I think.

4.  pg. 24, "By contrast, teliabilism seems to secure it easily." You
    may or may not have seen this typo, but I'll add it just in case.

-------------------------------------------

### Question time

-   Well-foundedness was introduced later by Feldman, it isn't there on
    the literature of foundationalism or coherentism. "Current-time
    slice theories." There can be no longer causal process.
    -   There was a tradition in logical positivists, that psychological
        factors do not belong in justification. Many important
        philosophers were anti-psychologistic.
        -   Influetial idea that the context of discovery, "thinking up"
            the idea, as opposed to the context of justification. The
            logic of justification or confirmation, that's one thing,
            and that's to be studied by formal logic and confirmation
            theory. Philsophy of science wing of epistemology.

    -   How you came to believe it is a psychological issue.
    -   It's be chosen because:
        1.  It's influential.
        2.  It's a nice contrast to reliablism.
            -   Fits nicely internalism/externalism.

-   The canonical way of talking about doxastic: "*p* is justified in
    *D* for *S* at *t*."
    -   *D* could be believing, disbelieving, or suspending
        justification.
    -   Does this mean *S* **does** believe it?
    -   Some people definitely think of propositional justification as
        the main type philosophers are interested in.

-   Propositional justification makes it difficult to talk about causal
    theories.
-   Propositional justification is defined in terms of doxastic, "If you
    were to hold this doxastic attitude."
-   Most epistemologists think knowledge requires justification.
    -   What type?

-   On the example of Chad and his poor reasoning
    -   I do not think that reliablism gets it right or that it's a
        problem for evidentialism.

-   Some background on evidentialist position:
    -   Evidence is always mental states
        -   There are experiential mental states.
        -   There are doxastic mental states, belief, disbelief, and
            suspension.

    -   If states fit the belief, then the belief is justified.
    -   *S* has *D* towards *p* on the basis of *E*.
    -   Just the states are not alone.
    -   It does not come from the specific case to the general.
        -   There is a problem with this generalization thing.
        -   If by virtue of the fact that Chad gets in wrong in these
            specific circumstances he is not justified in the instances
            where Chad gets it right, then this is a counterexample to
            reliablism as well. Imagine Chad gets it right for 3/4
            times. This reliably gets the truth. But he is still
            unjustified because he could have gotten it wrong. (I think,
            will expand later.)

### Presentation on Evidentialism

-   **Epistemically justified**: Doxastic attitude *D* towards
    propositions *p* is epistemically justified for *S* at *t* if and
    only if having *D* towards *p* fits the evidence *S* has at *t*.
-   **Well-foundedness**: A belief is well-founded only if:
    1.  It is justified;
    2.  It was formed based on a suitable body of evidence.

-   There are three different questions according to Conee and Feldman:
    1.  Is she epistemically responsible in believing *p*?
    2.  Is her belief that *p* well-founded?
    3.  Is her belief that *p* justified?

### Reliablism

-   What do you mean by a process?
    -   It's maybe not *wholly* mental.
    -   Does it start with the environment?
        -   "He formed the belief about the color of the fruit in queer
            light."

    -   Uncle Floyd and Niece Sally
        -   Niece Sally believes Uncle Floyd, it starts with her
            auditory system, it begins with the input to the auditory
            system. Start from the inner ear? And then go into the
            neuro-processing of the ear.
        -   Perhaps it begins with what the person says.
        -   Goldman likes to keep the process on the inside, "skin in."

-   There are **belief-independent processes** and **belief-dependent
    processes**

September 23th, 2013 <small>Chapter 2, part II, 'Internalism vs. Externalism'</small>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Framing the Debate

-   Evidentialism belongs to internalism
    -   While process reliablism belongs to externalism.
    -   They are rivals for what are called "j-factors."
    -   Externalism claims that all justifying factors are external,
        internalism thinks they are internal.
    -   Mentalism is a prime example of externalism.
    -   Since truth is a function outside the mind, process reliablism
        is external.

-   Externalism has the air of being the default position because
    internalism's premise is that *all* justifying factors are internal
    to agents, and externalism's premise is that *not all* j-factors are
    internal.
    -   Externalism isn't as strong.
    -   Internalism has some proofs to do.

-   There are two approaches to internal justifiers:
    1.  Mental states
    2.  "Directly accessible" to the agent at time of doxastic decision
        making.

-   Ethical theory regularly work within normativity and rules.
    -   A wrong action may fail to be within a rule.
        -   A right action may be within the rules.

    -   "we can say that *a doxastic attitude toward a proposition* is
        **justified** just in case *it conforms to what is permitted by
        correct epistemic rules* and unjustified in case it doesn’t
        conform to such rules"
        -   This is an externalist notion, surely.
        -   "If S's circumstances include the possession of a certain
            body of evidence relevant to P, then the correct rules may
            permit S to believe P."
        -   If S's doxastic attitude toward a proposition P is
            justified, then it conforms to what is permitted by correct
            epistemic rules.
        -   If S's doxastic attitude towards a proposition P conforms to
            what is permitted by correct epistemic rules, then it is
            justified.

-   What is meant by calling a justificationally relevant fact
    "internal"?
    -   Two approaches:
        1.  An older approach, anything that is **directly accesible**
            to the subject at the time of decision making.
            -   What is included in directly accessible?
            -   Introspection.
            -   *a priori* cognition

-   A reason that might motivate internalists is that if you restrict
    what might justify someone to those facts under their cognition,
    then they can know just from themselves whether or not they are
    justified.
    -   For instance, a cook book needs to be usable!
    -   While this is a nice motivation for studying knowledge, I do not
        think you should restrict yourself to one view of knowledge or
        justification because it helps people. What will help people is
        the correct, coherent view.
        -   "directions to which any epistemic agent can **conform**"

    -   Another approach is the **infallible guidance** approach, that
        the right rules will infallibly lead a subject to truth.

### Internalism and Inferential Rules

> **(INF)** If agent *S* has beliefs in propositions *K*, *L*, *M*, *N*
> (at time *t*), and proposition *P* is logically entailed by the
> conjunction of *K*, *L*, *M*, *N*, then *S* is permitted (at time *t*)
> to believe *P*.

-   So what about beliefs that *S* holds but doesn't have access to at
    time *t* but still uses to form the belief that *P*.
    -   All the time in science, portions of problems are abstracted and
        ignored for the sake of being able to get work done.
    -   If challenged, *of course* the subject believes that portion of
        the body of evidence supporting *P*, but the subject doesn't
        necessarily need that support to form the belief that *P*.
    -   It's not that it would suffice not to have this proposition, say
        *M*, it's just that it's not necessary.
    -   Goldman writes that internalism is vindicated only when all
        justifiers are internal, which is a definition, but is this type
        of doxastic attitude or propositional support captured by
        internal or external?

-   **(INF\*)** adds the condition of the belief being justified,
    because it's not enough that the belief be a belief.
    -   Justification comes from an external source,

### Questions

1.  "we can say that a doxastic attitude toward a proposition is
    justified just in case it conforms to what is permitted by correct
    epistemic rules and unjustified in case it doesn’t conform to such
    rules" This reads like a default application of normativity to
    epistemology, but then you write, "If S's circumstances include the
    possession of a certain body of evidence relevant to P, then the
    correct rules may permit S to believe P."
    -   This uses an account of justification.
    -   I don't understand how body of evidence got into this
        formulation. I think that evidentialists might like this
        formulation, but it could just as easily be something like, "If
        S's circumstances include the possession of a certain
        belief-forming process relevant to P, then the correct rules may
        permit S to believe P."
    -   Is there any reason that you used this language? A neutral
        application would be, "If S's doxastic attitude towards a
        proposition P conforms to what is permitted by correct epistemic
        rules, then it is justified."
    -   This would allow a normative evaluation of epistemology to
        remain agnostic about the correct account of justification.

2.  I noticed that the chapter was devoted largely to the reasons that
    internalism cannot work, (I think) largely because justification
    comes in some way from the truth of the proposition, and this is not
    accessible in any of the right ways. I see that externalism is the
    rejection of internalism, and so therefore any refutation of
    internalism makes externalism more compelling, but I still believe
    that we need independently good and compelling reasons to be an
    externalist.
3.  Are there any coherent and compelling compatiblist positions about
    the internalism/externalism debate? From the reading, I understand
    that many necessary types of justification are best understood as
    external and that the chapter doesn't think there are no internal
    factors, but I don't see why one needs to be more prominent than the
    other. Justification's link to the truth and normative epistemic
    rules are clearly external factors, but an agent's access and
    conformity is, very generally, part of a process which ends
    internally.

### Organizational

-   Next week we begin the knowledge portion of the course.
-   This is the longest of the three knowledge chapters.
-   Two sessions on this chapter.
-   For chapter 5, the first half of the chapter and 1 extra reading,
    and that's posted.
    -   Nozick.

### Internalism

-   It's important for internalism that the evidence for a belief be
    possessed at time of the belief forming, decision making.
    -   Goldman is not shooting at a straw man with this restrictive
        time.
    -   Sometimes counterexamples and debates turn onto a feature of
        internalism instead of the primary feature.

-   Why is process reliablism externalism?
    -   What processes? Belief forming processes.
        -   This is internal.

    -   What reliablism? Reliablism to the truth.
        -   This is external.

### Questions

-   "Background belief-forming processes"
-   Standing belief, "dispositional"

> If agent S has justified beliefs in propositions K, L, M, N (at time
> t), and S thinks that proposition P is logically entailed by the
> conjunction of K, L, M, N, then S is permitted (**at** time t) to
> believe P.

-   I think a better rule would be *from* time *t* **onward**.
    -   I do not think you need the justifying beliefs to be standing,
        because that would be too strong.

### Presentation

-   Connee and Feldman give examples for internalism because it's "good"
    to believe that one persons belief is better justified than another
    belief.
    -   In the example of Bob and Ray, what makes internalism compelling
        is that Bob went outside and "internalized" the external
        justification from the newspaper.
    -   This is a bad example because the belief is made good by the
        fact that there are *both* internal and external factors.
    -   "Best explained by"

#### Perception

-   "He perceives that *p*."
-   "Perceptual experience", which is something *in the head* from the
    eyes, ears.

September 30th, 2013 <small>Chapter 3, part I, 'Defining Knowledge'</small>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   'Know' is the eighth most commonly used verb in English.
    -   By contrast, 'justified belief' is used much more infrequently.

-   We want a good definition of knowledge to solve the problem of
    **skepticism about knowledge**.
    -   The most common reason we want a good definition of knowedlge.
    -   Descartes' evil deceiver.
    -   Are you a brain in a vat?

### The Traditional View of Knowledge: Knowledge as JTB

-   K = JTB

#### The truth condition

-   If someone claims to know something, which we later find out to be
    false, we feel justified in complaining that they didn't know after
    all.
-   Sometimes, however, we will say things like, "I just *knew* it, but
    it wasn't so."
    -   **free indirect speech**: One can speak from the perspective of
        someone with more limited or false information.

#### The belief condition

-   Knowledge is a matter of possessing the truth, and the sort of
    possession involved seems to be psychological.
    -   Memory and Radford cases.
        -   "Something *like* belief."

-   When you say, "I *merely* believe it.", you likely really know, but
    are concealing some information for some reason or another.

#### The justification condition

-   In the **Meno**, the **Gorgias**, the **Theatetus**, and elsewhere,
    Socrates distinguishes knowledge from right opinion.
    -   If you form lucky beliefs, they do not constitute knowledge
        because they are *unjustified*.
    -   They are degrees of justification, like chicken-sexers and those
        with master intuition.

### The Gettier problem

-   Gettier's assumptions:
    1.  **Fallibism about justification**: A belief can be justified
        even if it is false.
    2.  **Justification closure**: If you are justified in believing P,
        P entails Q, and you (competently) deduce Q from P and accept Q
        as a result of this deduction, then you are justified in
        believing Q.

-   With these two assumptions in place, Gettier gives two cases which
    he thinks are cases of having JTB while at the same time lacking
    knowledge.
    -   If he's right, the JTB cannot be knowledge because the
        conditions are insufficient.

-   Types of Gettier cases:
    1.  Smith, Jones, and the Job.
    2.  Sheep on the Hill
    3.  Havit and Nogot
    4.  Barn Facade Country

-   What could we *add* to JTB to avoid Gettier?
-   Some virtues we should look for in an account of knowledge:
    1.  Knowledge should satisfy closure principles under competent
        deduction.
    2.  The account should show why knowledge is valuable, and why it's
        better than true belief.
    3.  The account should enable us to why when someone knows that P,
        they can appropriate use P as a premix in their reasoning.
    4.  The account should enable us to understand how someone could
        know that P without being justified with absolute certainty that
        P.

-   In addition to justification closure, there is **knowledge
    closure**: If you know that P, P entails Q, and you (competently)
    deduce Q from P and accept Q as a result of this deduction, then you
    know Q.
    -   JTB has knowledge closure, but it isn't assured that JTB+X will
        have knowledge closure.

-   Can you deduce from your knowledge that you have hands that you are
    not a brain in a vat?
    -   Having hands entails not being a brain in a vat.
    -   If you make this deduction, does this give you knowledge that
        you *aren't* a brain in a vat?
    -   Doesn't this beg the question?
    -   The principle of knowledge closure doesn't say you come to have
        new knowledge when you make deductions.
        -   It just says that you do know the conclusions of those
            deductions.
        -   What knowledge closure denies is that you can make the
            deduction but not know the conclusion.

    -   **abominable conjunction**: “I know I have hands, and from this
        I infer that I’m not a BIV. But I don’t know I’m not a BIV.”

### Defeasibility

-   A quality of Gettier cases is that there is some fact which if the
    believer learned, would cause them to revise their beliefs.
    -   These are called **defeaters**.
    -   There is a defeater for Henry's belief that he sees a barn: that
        he is in fake barn country.
    -   There is a defeater in Gettier's Smith, Jones, and the Job case
        too, which is that Jones will not get the job.
    -   But what of *defeater defeaters*?
        -   The Grabit case.

### No False Assumptions

-   Gettier cases don't always involve reasoning from false premises.
-   **No false assumptions account**: To know is to have justified true
    belief that one's belief isn't based on a false assumption.
    -   What does it means to be *based* on a false assumption?
        -   your belief is based on a false assumption just if were you
            to learn that the assumption is false then you would be
            justified in giving your belief.

    -   This condition satisfies the barn facade case.
    -   The assumption may be that "things are the way they seem to be."

### Reliability

-   What disqualifies Gettier cases from being knowledge is to do with
    the lack of an objective connection between the subject's belief and
    the truth.
-   **Causal account**: To know is to have justified true belief such
    that one’s belief is caused by the fact that makes it true.
-   When you see a sheep on a hill in a normal case, the sheep's being
    there *causes* you to see them which *causes* you to believe that
    there is a sheep on the hill.
    -   In the Gettier cases, however, your belief is caused by the
        sheep-shaped rock.

### Questions

1.  Reflective knowledge and appropriate reasoning.
    -   Don't use it in your reasoning unless you know it.
    -   There are some circumstances where you cannot use a piece of
        knowledge.
    -   What's the norm of assertion?
        -   When is it appropriate to assert something.
        -   An epistemological perspective.

2.  Defeasibility
    -   A wrinkle: two uses:
        1.  Justification defeater
        2.  Knowledge defeater

3.  Strength of conditions
    -   Is there a downside of making a knowledge-condition too strong?
        -   A condition *for* knowledge?
        -   If it ruled out many cases, if it's too strong, it rules out
            cases when it shouldn't rule them out.
        -   A bad analysis requires too much or too little, not getting
            the right prediction for knowledge.

    -   The possible solutions that McGrath suggests rules out too many
        cases where we would like to say that we have knowedlge, but
        "wouldn't this be harmless?" …
        -   We do not need to categorize our propositions to be
            knowedlge for them to still be useful.
        -   There is something that tis smuggled in here, which you
            think knowledge has to be something we can act on.
        -   It's standard analytical terms to get sufficient and
            necessary conditions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Questions

1.  pg. 30, on safety, "To know that P is to have justified true belief
    such that if you were to believe that P, P would be true.” This
    seems dangerously close to begging the question. ‘If you were to
    believe that P, then P would be true.’ in use will allow me to point
    to cases where an agent believes a falsehood and say that what’s
    wrong about the false belief is that the belief is false, and the
    cases where the agent believes a truth and say the condition is
    satisfied because the belief is true. How can safety make truth
    somehow continent on belief?
2.  pg. 30, safety continued. Furthermore, it also seems very close to
    being equivalent with a Williamson’s thought that knowledge is
    unanalyzable, because the formulation holds that we form JTBs
    “somehow” and it means they’re true. Do or can knowledge-firsters
    subscribe to safety?
3.  pg. 34, on relevant alternatives, "To know that P is to have JTB
    where one’s evidence rules out all the relevant alternatives to P.”
    Would “nearby possible worlds” be a good account of what is a
    relevant alternative? Admittedly, I haven’t read Lewis and I do not
    know how precise or supported the notion of “nearby” is.
4.  pg. 4, on skeptical arguments, "Unless I know I haven’t spent my
    life being deceived by an evil genius, I cannot know anything about
    the world around me (or even about mathematics or logic).” Why does
    this entail? I cannot see that it does or does not, but for the
    argument to be compelling.
5.  On skepticism, generally: I may not be able to provide justification
    for my not being a BIV or having an evil demon, but why does this
    necessarily affect my other candidates for knowledge? In “high
    standards contexts”, I’m satisfied in asserting something like,
    “It’s possible that I’m a BIV, have an evil demon, etc … and Obama
    is president.” The domain of the knowledge claim I’m making could be
    restricted to whatever is being appeared to me and true in that
    regard, and assume that I believe it and have valid justification.
    Is that too much to give up to skeptics?

### Relevant Alternatives, Constrastivism, and Closure

> **Relevant alternatives**: You know that *p* just when you have a JTB
> that *p* and your evidences **rules out** all the **relevant**
> alternatives to *p*.

-   **Ruling out** (RO):
    -   (RO)-**Sensitivity**: Your evidence rules out an alternative if
        and only if that if that alternative *had* obtained, you'd have
        very different evidence.
    -   (RO)-**Safety**: Your evidence rules out an alternative if and
        only if: you could not easily have had the same evidence while
        the alternative was the case.

-   **Relevance**: The relevance of an alternative *A* depends on the
    objective probability of *A*-like events given the kind of
    environment you're in and the kind of evidence you have.

> **Knowledge closure**: If you know that *p*, and *p* entails *q*, you
> know *q*.

-   For knowledge closure to hold, every relevant alternative to *q*
    must be a relevant alternative to *p*.
    -   *Relevant* must be **intersective**.
        -   Blue is *intersective* because "blue book" breaks down into
            "is a book" and "is blue."
        -   Small is not intersective because "small planet" does not
            break down into "is a planet" and "is small."

> **Constrastivism**: Knowledge is a three-place relation between a
> knower, a proposition, and another "contrasting" proposition.

-   Some important 'degrees' of knowing that *p* rather than *a*:
    1.  **Certainty**: *a* includes **all** alternatives to *p*;
    2.  **Relevance theorist's knowledge**: *a* includes **relevant**
        alternatives to *p*;
    3.  **Useful concept**: *a* includes **some** alternatives to *p*;
    4.  **No knowledge**: *a* includes **no** alternatives to *p*;

October 21st, 2013 <small>Chapter 5, 'Contextualism and Pragmatic Encroachment'</small>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   A recent development in epistemology is increased attention to
    ordinary language.
    -   Perhaps one of the failings of skepticism is it is not the same
        sense of "know" that we actually use.
    -   This is the contention of **contextualists**.

-   Furthermore, in analyzing the semantics of the word "know", new
    questions have arisen about knowledge itself.
    -   In particular, **action** and **assertion**.
    -   This discussion is labelled **pragmatic encroachment**.
        -   Whichwhether a person can knows can vary on the practical
            stakes.

### Contextualism

-   Context-sensitivty is familiar.
    -   For instance, the first-person pronoun "I" differs from
        situation to situation.

-   **Contextualism about knowledge attributes** claims that "knows" is
    similarly context sensitive.
-   If these sense of "know that" vary by demandingness, then we can see
    how "*S* knows that *P*" could be true in one context and false in
    another context.
    -   With *lax* and *demanding* contexts.
    -   What skepticism and the analysis of knowledge might be up to is
        *shiftiness* with the word "know."

> Compare ‘empty’. If I say that the refrigerator is empty, when it only

-   A good analogy are tabletops and flatness, consider the argument:
    1.  All table-tops have some bumps on them.
    2.  If something has some bumps on it, it isn't flat.
    3.  Therefore, no tabletops are flat.

-   This is a *diagnosis* of skepticism rather than a *solution* to
    skepticism.
    -   The skeptical "problem" arises simply because we are *bewitched
        by language*, to put it in Wittgenstein's way.

-   Two clarifications:
    1.  What "knowing is" does not change, what saying "know" *means*
        changes.
    2.  "Know" is not lexically ambigious like bank or pen.

-   The contextualist needs a good story on the *implementation* of
    contextualism. There are two approaches:
    1.  **Relevant alternatives** approach and
    2.  **Epistemic standards** approach.

#### Relevant alternatives implementation

-   **Relevant Alternatives Implementation**: A claim “*S* knows that
    *P*” is true in a context of speech *C* iff *S* can rule out all
    alternatives to *P* that *C* determines as relevant.

#### The standards implementation

-   The relevant alternatives approach doesn’t set up a **standard of
    goodness of epistemic position** and declare that one can’t know
    anything unless one meets that standard for the proposition.
-   **Standards implementation**: A claim “S knows that P” is true in a
    context of speech C iff S’s belief that P satisfies the epistemic
    standard determined by C.

#### Problems for the Contextualist diagnosis of skepticism

-   We will briefly consider three sorts of objections in what follows:
    1.  The diagnosis *concedes too much* to the skeptic.
    2.  The diagnosis *underestimates the resources* of the skeptic.
    3.  The diagnosis *misrepresents a substantial issue* as a *merely
        verbal* one.

##### Too concessive to the skeptic?

-   You *do* know that you have hands *irrespective* of standards or
    context or alternatives.

##### Underestimation of the skeptic’s resources?

-   The skeptic can avoid context-sensitity:
    1.  For any epistemic standard, unless I meet that standard for I am
        not a victim of an evil genius I don’t meet that standard for
        anything about the external world. 2. I don’t meet even ordinary
        low standards for I am not a victim of an evil genius. 3.
        Therefore, I don’t meet even ordinary low standards for any
        propositions about the external world, such as I have hands.

##### Misrepresenting a substantive issue as verbal

#### Contextualism apart from skepticism: the stakes-shifting cases

### Pragmatic Encroachment

#### The case for Pragmatic Encroachment

-   **Knowledge-Reasons (KR)**:If you know that P, then P is
    sufficiently warranted to be a reason you have to believe and do
    other things.
-   **Safe Reasons (final version)**: if P is sufficiently warranted to
    be a reason you have to do or believe something, then P is
    sufficiently warranted to justify you in that action or belief.

### Questions

1.  Regarding relevant alternatives, "A claim “S knows that P” is true
    in a context of speech C iff S can rule out all alternatives to P
    that C determines as relevant.” It does not seem immediately clear
    to me that all relevant alternatives are conceivable. There could
    exist a possible world which is a relevant alternative I need to
    discount on this view that I and my limited brain cannot imagine. Is
    this a problem for the view?
2.  Regarding the standards implementation, "The relevant alternatives
    approach doesn’t set up a standard of goodness of epistemic position
    and declare that one can’t know anything unless one meets that
    standard for the proposition.” What does goodness refer to in this
    context? Is it the sense of suitability, aptness, etc? Or is it the
    sense of virtue?
3.  Regarding safe reasons, "if P is sufficiently warranted to be a
    reason you have to do or believe something, then P is sufficiently
    warranted to justify you in that action or belief.” This seems open
    to a whole slew of counterexamples, specifically cases of useful but
    ultimately false beliefs. It is practical, but it does not seem
    necessary on knowledge. Is this formulation okay with attributing
    knowledge to, say, Ptolemic models?
4.  Regarding Bank Case A and B, is it possible to teem out the ethical
    issue from the epistemological issue? The ethical issue is regarding
    whether the person going to the bank is morally obligated given the
    level of justification. The epistemological issue is whether the
    person going to the bank actually is or isn’t justified.

### Announcements

-   No make-up class on October 28th, 2013.
-   Paper due November 4th, 2013.

### Presentation <small>The Bank Argument: A Non-Contextualist Explanation</small>

#### Bottom-line Up-front

-   Contextualists fail to consider a plausible explanation for the
    cases, one that does not require an appeal to contextualism.
    -   I will argue for this more plausible explanation.
    -   I will not argue that Contextualism is false.
        -   I simply hope to take away some motivation for it.

#### Contextualism

-   'knows that *p*' varies in its sense across context of speech. Thus,
    '*S* knows that *p*' can have one sense in one context of use and
    another in another context.

#### The Bank Argument

1.  In Case A, you speak the truth when you say, "I know it'll be open."
2.  In Case B, you speak the truth when you say "I don't know it'll be
    open."
3.  Your epistemic position is the same across Cases A and B
    (stipulated).
4.  If (3), then if 'know' had the same sense in the two contexts, then
    you couldn't speak the truth in both cases in saying what you do.
5.  So, 'know' must have a different sense in the two contexts (i.e.
    contextualism is true).

> The two invariantist objections we considered so far, the loose use
> objection to Premise 1 and the current objection to Premise 2 are
> similar in nature. They both maintain that a certain statement can be
> appropriate to make without being true, and they both try to explain
> what makes the statement appropriate despite being false. The question
> is whether their explanations are more plausible than Premises 1 and
> 2.

#### Goldman comments

-   People who publish in a good journal or book have thought *very
    closely* about the cases they've illustrated.
    -   The case is supposed to have *only the cases the author wants*.
    -   They wouldn't want any other peculiarities to set in.
    -   It would always be possible when you're given a case, say a
        Gettier one, and someone just says, "He doesn't know" and a
        philosopher thinks this is a JTB without K.
        -   Suppose someone says no, the reason he doesn't know is
            because *there is a gun to his head*.

-   On the basis that the agent thinks that certainty is necessary for
    knowledge.
-   If we're talking about philosophical investigations about a case,
    then we want the carefully constructed case that everyone uses and
    is aware of what ingredients went in and what features came out.
-   If you add a feature to a case and do not take away any, it is still
    too specific to be illuminating for what's captured by the more
    general case.
-   "How *natural* would it be to say this in this context."
    -   We're trying to understand the *language* of knowledge.
    -   Connect up theory of *language* with theory of *knowledge*.
        -   The meanings, senses, of languages.
        -   Is this a case in which this is a case of *f* or not a case
            of *f*?

-   No one has to explain a case that is inconsistent.
-   When you make a case, you want it to be a case that non-philosophers
    can read, understand, appreciate.
-   Philosophers would deal with how you deal with cases.

### Questions

1.  How does an invariantist arrive a non-arbitrary standard for the
    word "know"? How is one standard better than another?
    -   You're noticing that contextualism is usually opposed to
        invariantism now'a'days as a type of view.
    -   If you *don't* accept contextualism, you're going to be an
        invariantist.
    -   The main person responsible is Peter Unger for this distinction.
    -   One of two types of approaches:
        1.  The standard is always the same.
        2.  No, the standards *could vary*.

    -   "How could this view *possibly* be endorsed?"
    -   Unger's first book was called *Ignorance*, where everyone was
        ignorant because everyone knew nothing.
        -   He uses flatness as one of his examples.
        -   There are *absolute terms*, where the terms are "*X* is *F*,
            that *X* is as *F* as *F* can be."
            -   Know is an *absolute term*.
            -   This was his way of defending skepticism.
            -   To know is to have absolute certainty.

    -   To be honest, Goldman says, contextualism has made people worry
        that people are uneasy about invariantism.
        -   The *one unique threshold*.

    -   There a lot of vague words used categorically.

2.  On pg. 5, standards implementation, relevant alternatives. Do
    heightened stakes last through time? Could a standard diminish over
    time?
    -   We're studying relation, phenomena *F*, and we want to see if we
        have a case of *F*, to make an attribution of *F*.
        -   There is a difference between what knowledge *is* and what
            knowledge *attributions* are.
        -   "Knowledge relations." *Really knowing*, *with certainty*.

October 28th, 2013 <small>Chapter 6, 'Perceptual Justification'</small>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Perception is a source of knowledge.
    -   You come to know things about your surroundings.
    -   It is hard to see how we could know much about the world around
        us if we could not perceive how things are.

-   Perception is also a source of justified belief.
-   So far, this is just the obvious, when we ask *how* percetption
    provides us with knowledge and justfied belief.

> [S]ome of the hardest and most interesting questions in the
> epistemology of perception concern in the first instance how
> perception can provide justification.

### Preliminaries on perceptual experience

-   Perception, in paradigm cases, involves **perceptual experience**.
-   When we have experiences, things and their properties seem
    **present** to the mind in a way they do not in **non-perceptual
    thought**.

### Can experiences justify beliefs?

-   The best argument against perception being able to justify beliefs
    is the **Sellarsian dilemma**, after Wilfrid Sellars.

Dilemma
:   A dilemma usually takes the following form:

    1.  Either A or B is true.
    2.  If A is true, then such and such is true.
    3.  If B is true, then such and such is true.
    4.  Therefore, such and such is true.

    2 and 3 are the **horns** of the dilemma.

#### The case for answering "No."

Sellarsian dillemma
:   1.  Either experiences have propositional content or they do not.
    2.  If experiences have propositional content, then they can justify
        beliefs only if the experiences themselves are justified.
    3.  Experiences cannot be justified.
    4.  If experiences have propositional content, they cannot justify
        beliefs. (From 2 and 3)
    5.  If experiences lack propositional content, then having them
        cannot be havint a reason to believe anything.
    6.  If in having an experience we do not thereby have a reason to
        believe anything, then having an experience cannot justify a
        belief.
    7.  So, if experiences lack propositional content, then they cannot
        justify beliefs. (From 5 and 6)
    8.  Therefore, experiences do not justify beliefs.

Propositional content
:   Beliefs have propositional content, they are beliefs that *certain
    things are the case*.

:   The belief that the squirrel is on the railing has the propositional
    content that *the squirrel is on the railing*.

:   Desires and intentions have propositional content. When you desire
    something you always desire that such and such be the case.

Justification-from-Reasons View
:   If S is justified in believing that P, this holds in virtue of S’s
    \> having reasons to believe that P.

:   This says that you are justified in believing something this is
    because you have reason to believe it. This is related to premise 6.

Propositional View of Reasons
:   a reason for belief is a piece of information – a claim, a \>
    proposition – and you have a piece of information as a reason only
    \> if you justifiably believe it is true.

:   The propositional view secures premise 5.

-   Why can't we think of a headache itself as a reason for believing
    that S has a headache?
    -   Propositionalist reply: Reasons must be the sorts of things that
        we can *give* in defense of ourselves or others.
        -   Giving something in defense requires that it be articulable.
        -   Things like headaches and visual experiences are not
            articulable.
        -   I can *describe* these states, but I cannot *express* them.

#### Assuming they can, how?

-   There are two categories of how they could. - **Direct
    justification**
    -   **Indirect justification**

Indirect theories
:   -   "The apple looks green to you." How could that justify you in
        believing the apple is green?
        -   Don't you have to notice it looks green to you and then to
            believe it is green *on that basis*.
        -   According to indirect theories, yes.

    -   There are three problems for indirect theories:
        1.  It is difficult to get to the conclusion that the apple is
            green if all you have to start with is the justified belief
            that it looks green to you.
            -   This is hardly conclusive.

        2.  You might have justification to believe *p* but still lack a
            justified belief in the cases where you don't believe
            despite propositional justification or believe on grounds of
            wishful thinking.
        3.  Can’t one be wrong about even about how things look, sound,
            etc. to one? Couldn’t I get my experience wrong despite my
            best attempts to get it right?

Basing requirement on doxastic justification
:   Your belief that P is justified only if you are justified in \>
    believing P and you believe that P on the basis of the factors \>
    that make you justified in believing P.

### Dogmatism

-   The simplest direct theory holds that when you have an experience in
    which something looks, sounds, etc, a certain way to you, this
    experience alone is enough to justify you in believing it is that
    way, unless you have some special reason to think otherwise.
    -   the experience of a thing’s appearing a certain way to you
        provides you **immediate *prima facie* justification** to
        believe that the thing is that way.

Dogmatism
:   Whenever you have an experience in which a thing appears (i.e., \>
    looks, sounds, etc.) a certain way, *F*, to you, then you thereby \>
    have immediate prima facie justification to believe that it is \>
    *F*.

:   But this does not account for hallucinations in which nothing is
    appearing but it looks to you as if it is.

Dogmatism (expanded version)
:   Whenever you have an experience as of something being a certain way,
    \> *F*, to you, then you thereby have immediate prima facie \>
    justification to believe that it is *F*.

Skeptical assumption
:   In order for an experience of its looking to you that *P* to justify
    \> you in believing that *P*, you have to be independently justified
    \> in believing that you aren’t a brain in a vat (aren’t dreaming,
    \> etc.)

:   If dogmatism is true, then this assumption is false. All you need is
    the experience of a thing looking *F* to be justified in believing
    it is *F*

Cognitive penetrability objection
:   -   Do we “see” different things depending on which theories we
        accept?
        -   If we do, then if we use what we see to justify those
            theories, aren’t we going in a circle?
        -   For instance, preformationists believed that every human
            cell contained an embryo. Imagine one of them looked into a
            microscope and happened to see something that looked a
            little like an embryo. This person can not be as justified
            as a non-preformationist who daw the same thing for what it
            is, but on this view it may be.

    -   Consider other influences of our cognitive attitudes on our
        experiences
        -   A novice gold prospector wants to find gold and this desire
            makes him see the dusty nugget in his pan as gold. Is he
            justified?

:   An experience is cognitively penetrated just in case a cognitive \>
    state of the person penetrates (i.e., causally influences) the \>
    post-attentional processing of sensory input

#### The speckled hen objection

> Imagine seeing two hens, one with 48 speckles and the other 3. Before
> you count, you won’t be justified in thinking the first has
> 48-speckles, but you will be justified in thinking the second one has
> 3 speckles. The problem for dogmatism is that it seems that in some

> you aren’t. So we have a problem for dogmatism, the **speckled hen
> problem**.[^1]

##### Responses

Seemings
:   the dogmatist should understand experiences in the relevant sense as
    \> mental states in which it seems to the subject that a thing is F;
    \> only such seemings can justify[^2].

Mode of presentation
:   the dogmatism might claim *that only experiences in which a property
    \> is present* in a certain mode or way provide prima facie \>
    justification

Demonstrative
:   the dogmatist might severely restrict her dogmatism so that it only
    \> applies to beliefs *such as this thing is that way* if an object
    \> looks a certain way to you, you are *prima facie \> immediately
    \> justified only in believing that it is that way*.

### Sellars argument

#### Propositional content

-   Not all content is propositional, it can be smaller.
    -   Singular terms or concepts could be part of a proposition.
    -   "That iPad that Olivia is using." "That iPad" is a part.

-   The question is whether experiences as a mental state or any state
    is a propositional attitude.
    -   There is at least a subclass of mental states that have
        propositional content.

-   A feeling of pain, on the other hand, may not have propositional
    content. It's just a feeling or something like that.
-   So there are two kinds of mental states:
    1.  Phenomenal character, feeling.
    2.  Lacks phenomenal character, has propositional content.

-   Everybody agrees that having the property of propositional content
    is something that at least some mental states might have.
    -   In particular, perceptual experiences.

-   Sellars' way of defending coherentism by saying that *only beliefs
    can justify beliefs*.
    -   If you say that beliefs are the only thing that can do this, it
        affects its justificational status. **Justifiers**
    -   Which things and kinds of things are justifiers?
    -   Beliefs, justified beliefs, are justifiers.
    -   Perceptual experiences?
    -   Process reliablism confers justificational changes by means of
        *processes*.

-   If you make an inference from two premises to a conclusion and your
    inference and its structure are valid, then the fact that it is
    valid makes it justified. Or at least contributes.
    -   Or if it's invalid, then it contributes to its state.

#### Evidentialism and Internalism

-   For them, the only things that are justifiers are mental states.
-   Suppose Jones believes *p* and that "if *p* then *q*".
    -   Is he propositionally justified in believe in *q*?
    -   You're in a state such that if you were in that state, then it
        would be justified.

-   What are the things that confer the justificational status?
    -   It's not only that Jones believes it.
    -   It's also that the argument is *valid*.
        -   This is not a mental state.

-   Would it be plausible that only mental states are justifiers for
    doxastic?
    -   No, because for process reliablists, it's not only the doxastic
        *state* but the doxastic *process*.

-   There's a lot of room of play for justifiers.

#### The premises

> 1.  If experiences have propositional content, then they can justify
>     beliefs only if the experiences themselves are justified.

-   If we agree that nothing can be a justifier without itself being
    justified.

> 1.  But experiences cannot be justified[^3].

-   This is uncomfortable.

> 1.  If experiences lack propositional content, then having them cannot
>     be having a reason to believe anything.

-   This horn is being pursued by *having a reason*.
    -   We have not spoke much about reasons.
    -   It's hard to sum up use of the word "reason."
        -   Mostly until recently mainstream epistemologists have not
            been using "reason" as a favorite word.

#### Experience and Justification

-   If you think that experiences have propositional content, then you
    might think that the only beliefs that experiences have power over
    are the same ones. *V*(*G**S*) ⇔ *B*(*G**S*)

### Dogmatism

-   If we're going to be accurate about our representation of the world
    that everything happens from the analysis of the datum from the
    sense.
    -   You get sound waves, shapes, lights, etc.

-   How much penetrability happens from high-level beliefs?
    -   For present purposes, admit that it can happen *some of the
        time*.
    -   What should epistemologists do about this?
        -   Theory-ladenness and perception in the 50s and 60s for
            philosophy of science and Thomas Cuun and Hanson is that
            what you already believe and already be trained on, say the
            bird watcher and what they're trained to detect, then the
            training is in your memory and part of your prior cognition,
            can this warp your experience?
        -   A lot goes on without your being aware of it.

    -   For instance, distinguishing twins, sometimes you can determine
        *that **that** is Sally and that **that** is Sandra*, but not
        *how* or *why* this is the case.
        -   Does the processing make a causal difference in the way that
            things appear? Top-down, Bottom-up processing.

-   Your fears and emotions and wishes make it so that you "see" people
    you might want or not want to see.
-   Dogmatism takes the function of the what the perceptual state is
    like to be the only determining factor in justification.
    -   It's like jumping to a conclusion.

-   What if it turns out that observation *is not* pure and
    unadulterated?
    -   What if people in one laboratory have beliefs that make them
        observe to fit their theory in a way that contradicts the
        observations of people in another lab with another theory.
        -   If emotions distort beliefs, it could make it observation
            impossible.

> Maybe we have lower-level experiences that are not penetrated.

-   This is something that people in psychology and vision science
    insofar as perceptual belief, not all belief is perception based,
    what does it mean to be "directly perception based"?
    -   What is this special class and how is it picked out?
        -   The intuitive idea with which people start are the elements
            of the perceptual system.
        -   In the case of vision, there are shapes. Within visual
            science, people represent things in terms of
            [geons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geon_(psychology)).

-----------------------------------------

-   Theories of justification hold that j-factors, ones which affect
    another beliefs warrant, what are the justifiers?
    -   What are the *staes of affairs* that influence the status as a
        belief being satisfied or unsatisfied.

-   The problem for reliabalism is to define the process, but everything
    else is explicit and not obscure.
-   Maybe foundationalism, the perceptual side for instance, there is
    some reference to psychological work.
    -   So it's not just reliablism.
    -   It would be natural to bring into the picture questions of
        cognitive size is best positioned to address.
        -   There's nothing we really know everything about.

    -   It looks like addressing the question of "how do we go about
        achieving justified belief?" is an entree into cognitive
        science.
        -   The meliorative conception, "making better."
        -   If you want to make better your cognitive or intellectual or
            belief-forming or evidence-getting, you have to answer this
            question.
        -   For instance Descartes.

    -   The rationalist empiricist debate, what is our main capacity to
        get us to the truth. Some wanted to say *reason*. Some wanted to
        say *observation*.
        -   These are claims about how knowledge is acquired.
        -   Hume: "This is the only way to do it."
        -   So we're not leaving epistemology in doing this.

    -   It really sounds like a lot of early thinkers are talking about
        psychology. But there wasn't even such a word.
        -   So we're not abandoning the field.

    -   There are parts which has just lain fallow.

-   Meliorism "making better", well to talk about what we could do
    better we have to ask "What are we doing now?"
    -   Maybe psychology is the way of avoiding glitches.
    -   There general problem is "How should you go about conducting
        your intellectual affairs?

-   Looking at things from a psychological perspective
-   A big part of epistemology is making normative judgments of
    justification and warrant.

November 11th, 2013 <small>Chapter 9, 'Philosophy's Intuitional Methodology and the Role of Science'</small>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Armchair or the Laboratory? Where and How to Do Philosophy.

-   This chapter is concerned with a methodology that cuts across
	most branch of philosophy.
	-   A feature of philosophy that stands out because of disapproval
		a disuse from the sciences: *intuitions*.
	-   Empirical evidence is based on *observation*.
		-   *Truth* is obtained by observing the world.

-   Why is philosophy so different? Is this method legitimate?

Intuition

:   It is a seeming-that-$p$-is-the-case which is not based on 
	conscious perception, memory, or inference.

:   It is a sense that $p$ is the case that wells up in the mind without
	a readily specifiable reason; it just strikes one (often compellingly) 
	that P is so. 

:   In contrast to hunches or guesses, however, intuitions do not 
	feel arbitrary or ill-founded. On the contrary, they "present 
	themselves" as obvious and often routine.

> But why do we say that philosophers regularly appeal to such 
> seemings? Where and when do they appeal to them?

-   A principle context is when philosophers try to define or analyze
	a philosophically interesting term.
	-   For instance, *knowledge* in epistemology.
	-   Alternative, *causation* and *moral rightness*.
	-   Definitions typically seek the necessary and sufficient conditions
		for the use of the term.
	-   For instance, $JTB \to K \land K \to JTB$.
		-   But the Gettier's counterexample showed that at least one time,
			$\lnot K \to JTB$.
		-   $\lnot K$ was derived from intuition, whereas $JTB$ was derived
			from analysis and the case.
		-   All epistemologists, or most, agreed about the intuition, so
			the definition was shown to be insufficient.

> Exactly how did the "refutation" take place? Was there 
> some other theory of knowledge epistemologists agreed upon 
> from which they deduced that Smith did not know Q (the 
> job-getter proposition)?

-   No. There was no alternative theory of that sort.
	-   It *would* be wrong to classify it as knowledge, however.
	-   This is what philosophers call "having a intuition."

-   However, for a theory to be refuted, isn't it required that the
	person have a *bona fide* counterexample?
	-   How does the Gettier reader form a justified belief that
		Jones does not have knowledge?
		-   Well, apparently, intuition confers this justification.
	
	-   This is the role of intuition where *intuitions confer
		justification*, *intuitions serve as evidence*.

> What makes intuitions constitute evidence for their contents?
> Are they like perceptual experiences, which might serve an
> analogous role?

-   Maybe we are really wrong to grant this epistemic role to intuitions.
	-   Scientists never use them.
	-   Psychologists dismiss other psychologists that use them.
	-   So why should philosophers be allowed to use them?
		-   Maybe philosophers just arrogate to themselves what is in fact
			a dubious epistemic practice.
		-   This is what philosophers of the last few decades have worried
			about.

-   Intuitions are clearly not sense experiences
	-   They are not part of any empirical method.
	-   Philosophy, as we described it above, is more into thinking
		up definitions, analyses, and theories and using one's imagination
		to test them
	-   This "imaginative" testing, often called thought experiments,
		is in some respects what transpires in science.
		-   Philosophers want to test their theories too.

	-   Philosophers tests traditionally involve no manipulation of
		worldly subject matter to see how outcomes change.
		-   Merely imaginative constructs of possible scenarios.
		-   This can be done from the armchair, and thus constitutes
			an **armchair discipline**.
		-   Notice that mathematics may also be characterized as such.

### Rationalism vs. Empiricism

-   This entire issue harks back to an extremely important debate in the
	history of epistemology between *empiricism* and *rationalism*.
	-   The debate is framed between three rationalists:
		1.  Descartes
		2.  Spinoza
		3.  and Leibniz

	-   And three empiricists:
		1.  Locke
		2.  Berkeley
		3.  and Hume

Rationalism

:   emphasizes the role of *reason* in knowledge

:   paradigmatic cases include mathematical thought, logical thought,
	and other kinds of abstract thinking that feature purely abstract
	contents rather than sensory, or sense-derived concepts.

Empiricism

:   emphasizes the role of *sense-experience* in knowledge

:   highlighted the centrality of sense-based cognition and rationalists 
	the centrality of abstract modes of cognition.

:   Gained fairly clear ascendance in the early 20th century, because of the
	association between science and empiricism and the success of science

:   The rise of logical positivism berated the standing of rationalist
	notions of "rational insight" and "intuitive insight" and the like.

> ... [T]he truths of pure reason, the propositions which we 
> know to be valid independently of all experience, are so 
> only in virtue of their lack of factual content. 
> <cite>(A.J. Ayer, 1952. Language, Truth, and Logic. 
> New York: Dover, pp. 93-94)</cite>

-   Ayer did not wholly reject non-empirical knowledge.
	-   Relegated it to a lesser domain.

> Can we show that reliance on intuition in philosophical
> methodology has a firm epistemological ground?

### Kinds of Intuition and the Nature of Intuition

-   Presumably, intuitional states are propositional attitudes,
	which imply the state has two parts:
	1.  An attitude type
	2.  Propositional content

> Are logical and mathematical intuitions the same kind of
> mental states as moral intuitions? Type or content?

### A Criterion of Evidencehood

-   The author proposes *reliabilist evidencehood*, specifically
	*indicator reliablism*.

> The occurrence of an event or state of affairs of type
> $\Sigma$ is counted as evidence for proposition $p$ if
> $\Sigma$ is a generally reliable indicator of the truth
> of $p$.

-   For example, the fact that S seems to remember eating a 
	croissant for breakfast is evidence that he did eat a 
	croissant for breakfast.
	-   Analogously, why shouldn't it be plausible that 
		someone's having an intuition that Gettier's 
		coin-in-the-pocket example is not a case of knowledge 
		(on the part of Smith) should also be evidence?

> **(IND-EV)** If being in a propositional attitude of type $M$ 
> is a generally reliable indicator[^5] of the truth of $M$'s content,
> then if $S$ is in a token state of type $M$ with respect to 
> proposition $P$, this is evidence of the truth of $P$. It is
> evidence for $S$ of the truth of $P$, and if another person $S$' 
> is justified in believing that $S$ is in this state, then $S$'s 
> being in a token state of type $M$ is also evidence for $S$' of 
> the truth of $P$.[^4]

### Philosophical Intuitions as Classification Judgements

-   A pervasive part of cognitive activity is: 
	-   **(A)** forming representations of *categories*.
		-   Ex: dogs, books, red things, explosions

	-   **(B)** *classifying* or *categorizing* *objects* or *events*
		-   Ex: Is this animal a book or dog?

	-   Spontaneous answers to classifications of knowledge
		are intuitions.

-   If intuitions are *reliable indicators* of the truth of their 
	contents, then they qualify as a non-empirical type of evidence.
	-   We can find this out with experimental philosophy, Goldman
		claims.

### Applying the Experimental Method to the Reliability Question

-   If a pool of participants in a dichotomous (yes-no) survey 
	question splits their responses 60% to 40%, we can infer that 
	at least 40% of the respondents were giving wrong answers, 
	and therefore have wrong intuitions.[^6]
-   The results of X-Phi diverged from near unanimity from philosophers
	with regards to Gettier.
	-   A 74% majority of subjects with Western ethnic origins 
		responded that Smith in one of the "only believes" the 
		proposition rather than "really knows" it.
		-   East Asian and Indian subjects thought Smith knew.

-   This undercuts the prospect of intuitions being reliable
	indicators of the truth.
-   The results have been undercut by lack of replication.
-   Also do these results equate to intuitions? Maybe not.
-   Also maybe these subjects do not have the relevant or necessary
	tools to sufficiently analyze the cases.
-   *Properly conducted* scientific methodology is very relevant to
	philosophy.
	-   The remedy is *better science*.


[^6]: We can construct a Sorites paradox from this.

### A More Refined Model of Classification Reliability

> **(C-J RELIABILITY)**: The general process of classification
> judgment has high conditional reliability if and only if it
> outputs a high ratio of true classification judgments whenever
> both the case representation and the category representation
> are accurate.

### Possible Targets of Philosophical Theorizing and the Method of Philosophical Analysis

-   A traditional aim of analytic philosophy is to analyze, define,
	or give an account of philosophically interesting targets.
	-   According to the free-floater approach, philosophy should
		not concern itself with mere word meanings.
		-   It should concern itself with the *content* of words.

-   The notion of "direct acquaintance" is appealing to rationalists.
