------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Concepts and Questions of Epistemology

-   Epistemology is the study of knowledge and related phenomena.
-   Why is this important?
    -   It can lead to better decisions.

-   How do we get truths? **Justification**.
    -   A justified or warranted belief is more likely to be true.
    -   A randomly or haphazardly chosen belief is less likely to be
        true.
    -   So how do we get the first?

-   What is a belief (alternatively opinion?)
    -   It is a *psychological attitude towards a proposition*.
        -   Where a proposition is (roughly) content which purports to
            be fact.

    -   To believe is to *mentally assent* to a propositions.
    -   Possible doxastic attitudes:
        1.  **Belief**, to mentally assent.
        2.  **Disbelief**, to mentally dissent.
        3.  **Suspension**, to neither assent nor dissent.

> It is widely thought that forming a belief that is reasonable,
> warranted, or justified is the best means available of forming a true
> belief

-   Epistemic evaluations are different from moral evaluations.
    -   They express evaluations on an *intellectual dimension*.

-   Truth and justification are not equivalent.
    -   Truth is purely metaphysical.
    -   It is true or false *of the world*.
    -   You can have a justified false belief.

-   Justification is one form of epsitemic evaluation, but perhaps there
    are others.
    -   For instance, rationality may be another, unique or not.

-   Some points of widespread agreement:
    1.  Knowledge implies truth;
    2.  A person must believe p, or have reasonably high credence in p,
        in order to know it;
    3.  Knowledge requires justification.

### The Epistemic Regress Problem

-   Many sources of justification are inference.
-   Justification needn't be spoken.
-   The structure of justification is a tree, where properly justified
    beliefs (nodes) inherit justification from roots
    -   With roots in truth?

-   Where does the original justification come from?
    -   This is the **regress problem**.

-   Possible solutions:
    -   **Infinitism**: An unending continuation of reasons, without
        repetition or end.\
    -   **Foundationalism**: An ending tree of reasons.
    -   **Coherentism**: A tree that loops back on itself.
    -   **Skepticism**. None of the first three solutions to the regress
        problem is satisfactory.

-   There are two types of ways of looking at justification with regards
    to time.
    -   **Synchronic**: A synchronic reason for a belief happens at the
        same time as the target belief.
    -   **Diachronic**: A diachronic reason is unavailable at the
        formation of the target belief?

### Infinitism

> Infinitism is rarely given serious consideration.

-   If justification goes back infinitely far, then we hold infinitely
    many beliefs?
    -   No human person has infinitely many beliefs.

-   Perhaps justification needn't originate anywhere.
-   What about with regards to people holding infinitely many beliefs?
    -   **Doxastic justification** is a property of existing beliefs.
    -   **Propositional justification** arises from the state or
        condition of an epistemic agent that entitles her to believe a
        proposition.

> infinitism can be interpreted as the view that there are infinitely
> many propositions (rather than beliefs) that form chains of
> inferential justification.

-   This may support foundationalism, however, because if justification
    isn't (ultimately) a doxastic attitude, then there is an end to the
    held beliefs which can serve an agent.
    -   There is no way that infinitist ghost propositions can be
        measured without making the propositions becoming beliefs.

-   "Justification is limited in RAM, unlimited in HDD storage."

### Coherentism

-   Coherentism is a minority view today, but historically important.
    -   Largely, the view *tolerates circular inference*.
    -   "Sometimes circularity is okay."

-   There are no "privileged beliefs" that are tethered to truth, but
    rather any net of self-supporting justification are valid
    epistemologically.
    -   "Justification is a circularly linked list."

-   Coherence and justifiedness are not intimately linked at all, and
    coherence and truth are similarly unlinked (thought not for the same
    reasons, justification and truth are distinct).

### Foundationalism and Basic Beliefs

> Foundationalism’s response to the regress problem says that every root
> in a tree of (successful) inferential justification terminates after
> finitely many steps.

-   Foundational beliefs have two crucial properties:
    -   The are *uninferred*;
    -   They are justified.

-   There are four questions that foundationalism must address to
	succeed:
	>   1.  Exactly what does it take for a belief to attain the status of 
	>       "justified" in an unmediated or non-inferential fashion? 
	>       What must take place or hold true of a belief to confer 
	>       on it the property of being immediately justified?  
	>   2.  Which types of belief or families of belief qualify as 
	>       immediately justified? What kinds of propositional 
	>       contents lend themselves to immediate justification?  
	>   3.  What strength of justification do immediately justified 
	>       beliefs need to attain according to foundationalism?  
	>       Must basic beliefs exhibit the highest grade of 
	>       justification, i.e., certainty, infallibility, or 
	>       incorrigibility?  Or can basic beliefs have weaker 
	>       degrees of justification while still being basic?
	>   4.  Assuming that many immediately justified beliefs are 
	>       available, does this enable epistemic agents to draw 
	>       enough reasonable inferences that they can attain a 
	>       large corpus of justified beliefs (both basic and non-basic), 
	>       enough to dispel the specter of skepticism that is 
	>       often laid at foundationalism's doorstep?

### Concepts and Questions

-   Doxastic attitudes, "Epistemic terms of appraisal"
    -   Beliefs, non-belief,
    -   Tripartite approach.
    -   What are others?
        -   Degrees of conviction
        -   "High confidence", expresses a doxastic attitude, on a range
            of attitudes.

    -   It's not like desiring, or hating.
        -   It's an attitude about truth or falsity.
        -   An "intellectual" attitude.
        -   Abstaining from being committal.

-   Are beliefs epistemic states?
    -   Lots of philosophers talk about beliefs as epistemic states.
        -   Doxastic attitudes are psychological states.
        -   Epistemic states are evaluations on intellectual dimensions.

-   "Know" is traditionally thought not to be an entirely mental state.
    -   It's partly:
        -   Having a belief.
        -   Having a justified belief.
        -   And being true.

    -   Knowledge is a "mental state plus …"
        -   Something like justification
        -   An epistemic component.

-   We never want to mix up truth and justification.
    -   Justification is limited to an epistemic or doxastic agent.
    -   Justified *for whom*?
    -   Justified *when*?

-   "You're justified in believing, but you don't."
    -   Propositional justification.

-   "You're justified in believing, and you do."

### The Regress Problem

-   An inferential regress.
-   To give a reason is to say something.
    -   You might have a reason, but not say it.

-   The skeptic thesis:
    -   We do not have as many JTBs as we think we do commonsensically.

-   If you say we're talking about doxastic justification, then yes,
    maybe we cannot have infinitely many psychological states.
    -   "Propositional justifiedness"

### Coherentism

-   Was popular in idealism (one or another) in Britain and American
    dominant.
    -   These involved people that are not read anymore.
    -   Royce, Bradley.
    -   Late 19th century.
    -   Very popular
    -   They often talk about in the kind of abstract way that
        infinitism will be defended.
    -   The methodology was much more abstract.

-   There are senses within belief.
    -   The belief *itself*, the psychological action.
    -   The belief's *content*, the proposition believed.

-   We want to distinguish between saying that "*p* is justified" and
    "*p* is justified for *S* at time *t*."
    -   The second one is okay and is precise.
    -   The first is not useful in epistemology.
    -   Propositions do not do any justification of their own,
        propositions are not justified.
        -   Beliefs *in* propositions *by* agents are justified *for
            them*.
        -   You do not get anything from propositional coherence.

-   What's the relationship between rationality and justification.
    -   There's no common practice.

-   Can coherence account for non-coherent justified beliefs?

### Foundationalism

-   Descartes thought that "basic beliefs" (new terminology) are about
    the agent's mental states.
-   Well what are basic/immediate beliefs like?
    -   Early on, beliefs about mental states.
    -   Later, beliefs from perception.

September 16th, 2013 <small>Chapter 2, part I, 'Evidentialism vs. Reliabilism'</small>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **justifier** refers to anything that helps make a belief state
    justified or unjustified.
    -   Anything that contributes to the **justificational status** of a
        target belief.

> How can one legitimately infer outward (to the external world),
> forward (to the future), and backward (to the past) from the
> indicated, very limited, data-set?

-   **Evidentialism**: all (positive or negative) justifiers of a belief
    held by epistemic agent *S* at time *t* are evidential states *S* is
    in at *t*.
    -   there must be a relation of **fittingness** that holds between
        the attitude of belief (directed at *P*) and *S*’s total
        evidential states at *t*.
    -   *X* is evidence for *Y* just in case possessing *X* enhances a
        person’s justification for believing *Y*.

> what justifies me in thinking that the fusiform gyrus of my right
> occipital cortex is being activated is that the fusiform gyrus of my
> right occipital cortex is being activated

-   **Reliablism**: Belief *B* is justified if and only *B* is produced
    by a reliable belief-forming process, i.e., a process that has a
    tendency to generate (belief) outputs with a high percentage of
    truths.

### Questions

1.  pg. 4, "According to evidentialism, all (positive or negative) justifiers of a belief held by epistemic agent S at time t are evidential states S is in at t." This took a few reads and a cross-check with the Wikipedia to fully understand. Specifically, I didn't know what it meant for S to be "in an evidential state." When I worked out what that meant, the definition was easily understood.
	-  This was supremely cleared up on pg. 7, with the precise formulation of evidentialism, what it implies.
2.  pg. 10, "Nonetheless, it is perfectly plausible that her belief in this proposition is justified." This actually happens all the time! It may add something to the credibility and plausibility of the case to name the psychology term for it: Source Amnesia.
	-  pg. 11, "it plays no causal role in her current belief in D." I cannot find anything defined with that variable, thought I think I can reasonably assume it's the claim about the earth.
3.  pg. 18, "Thus, wishful thinking is “bad” because the beliefs it outputs are only occasionally true." Wouldn't wishful thinking still be bad even if the beliefs it outputs were more often than not true? It's not clear to me from the example wishful think is bad because of unreliability, but it is certainly unreliable.
	-  pg. 18, "The overextended version of disjunctive syllogism is “bad” because it would frequently lead to erroneous conclusions even when the inputs to it are true." This is closer to my intuition, but all it would take for me to think that it was bad was one case where even one invalid logical schema was used. A good schema is always gets good conclusions for when the inputs are true.
	-  After I read the definition for process reliablism a bit further down along with the suitably vague portion, it seems very plausible for longer belief forming processes like perception (which is vague, which has variable successes and failures), but not so applicable to using bad logic rules. I think the difference is that a bad logic schema has concrete, knowable cases of when it always gets it wrong.
	-   After (CR) and (UR), this was cleared up I think. 
4.  pg. 24, "By contrast, teliabilism seems to secure it easily." You may or may not have seen this typo, but I'll add it just in case.

-------------------------------------------

### Question time

-   Well-foundedness was introduced later by Feldman, it isn't there on
    the literature of foundationalism or coherentism. "Current-time
    slice theories." There can be no longer causal process.
    -   There was a tradition in logical positivists, that psychological
        factors do not belong in justification. Many important
        philosophers were anti-psychologistic.
        -   Influetial idea that the context of discovery, "thinking up"
            the idea, as opposed to the context of justification. The
            logic of justification or confirmation, that's one thing,
            and that's to be studied by formal logic and confirmation
            theory. Philsophy of science wing of epistemology.

    -   How you came to believe it is a psychological issue.
    -   It's be chosen because:
        1.  It's influential.
        2.  It's a nice contrast to reliablism.
            -   Fits nicely internalism/externalism.

-   The canonical way of talking about doxastic: "*p* is justified in
    *D* for *S* at *t*."
    -   *D* could be believing, disbelieving, or suspending
        justification.
    -   Does this mean *S* **does** believe it?
    -   Some people definitely think of propositional justification as
        the main type philosophers are interested in.

-   Propositional justification makes it difficult to talk about causal
    theories.
-   Propositional justification is defined in terms of doxastic, "If you
    were to hold this doxastic attitude."
-   Most epistemologists think knowledge requires justification.
    -   What type?

-   On the example of Chad and his poor reasoning
    -   I do not think that reliablism gets it right or that it's a
        problem for evidentialism.

-   Some background on evidentialist position:
    -   Evidence is always mental states
        -   There are experiential mental states.
        -   There are doxastic mental states, belief, disbelief, and
            suspension.

    -   If states fit the belief, then the belief is justified.
    -   *S* has *D* towards *p* on the basis of *E*.
    -   Just the states are not alone.
    -   It does not come from the specific case to the general.
        -   There is a problem with this generalization thing.
        -   If by virtue of the fact that Chad gets in wrong in these
            specific circumstances he is not justified in the instances
            where Chad gets it right, then this is a counterexample to
            reliablism as well. Imagine Chad gets it right for 3/4
            times. This reliably gets the truth. But he is still
            unjustified because he could have gotten it wrong. (I think,
            will expand later.)

### Presentation on Evidentialism

-   **Epistemically justified**: Doxastic attitude *D* towards propositions *p* is
    epistemically justified for *S* at *t* if and only if having *D*
    towards *p* fits the evidence *S* has at *t*.
-   **Well-foundedness**: A belief is well-founded only if:
	1.  It is justified;
	2.  It was formed based on a suitable body of evidence.

-   There are three different questions according to Conee and Feldman:
	1.  Is she epistemically responsible in believing *p*?
	2.  Is her belief that *p* well-founded?
	3.  Is her belief that *p* justified?

### Reliablism

-   What do you mean by a process?
	-   It's maybe not *wholly* mental.
	-   Does it start with the environment?
		-   "He formed the belief about the color of the fruit in
			queer light." 

	-   Uncle Floyd and Niece Sally
		-   Niece Sally believes Uncle Floyd, it starts with her
			auditory system, it begins with the input to the auditory
			system. Start from the inner ear? And then go into the neuro-processing
			of the ear. 
		-   Perhaps it begins with what the person says.
		-   Goldman likes to keep the process on the inside, "skin in."

-    There are **belief-independent processes** and **belief-dependent processes**

September 23th, 2013 <small>Chapter 2, part II, 'Internalism vs. Externalism'</small>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Framing the Debate

-   Evidentialism belongs to internalism
	-   While process reliablism belongs to externalism.
	-   They are rivals for what are called "j-factors."
	-   Externalism claims that all justifying factors are external,
		internalism thinks they are internal.
	-   Mentalism is a prime example of externalism.
	-   Since truth is a function outside the mind, process reliablism
		is external.

-   Externalism has the air of being the default position because
	internalism's premise is that *all* justifying factors are internal
	to agents, and externalism's premise is that *not all* j-factors
	are internal.
	-   Externalism isn't as strong.
	-   Internalism has some proofs to do.

-   There are two approaches to internal justifiers:
	1.  Mental states
	2.  "Directly accessible" to the agent at time of doxastic decision
		making.

-   Ethical theory regularly work within normativity and rules.
	-   A wrong action may fail to be within a rule.
		-   A right action may be within the rules.

	-   "we can say that *a doxastic attitude toward a proposition* is **justified** just in case *it conforms to what is permitted by correct epistemic rules* and unjustified in case it doesn’t conform to such rules"
		-   This is an externalist notion, surely.
		-   "If S's circumstances include the possession of a certain
		 	body of evidence relevant to P, then the correct rules 
			may permit S to believe P."
		-   If S's doxastic attitude toward a proposition P is
			justified, then it conforms to what is permitted by
			correct epistemic rules.
		-   If S's doxastic attitude towards a proposition P conforms
			to what is permitted by correct epistemic rules, then
			it is justified.

-   What is meant by calling a justificationally relevant fact "internal"?
	-   Two approaches:
		1.  An older approach, anything that is **directly accesible**
			to the subject at the time of decision making.
			-   What is included in directly accessible?
			-   Introspection.
			-   *a priori* cognition

-   A reason that might motivate internalists is that if you restrict
	what might justify someone to those facts under their cognition,
	then they can know just from themselves whether or not they are
	justified.
	-   For instance, a cook book needs to be usable!
	-   While this is a nice motivation for studying knowledge,
		I do not think you should restrict yourself to one view
		of knowledge or justification because it helps people.
		What will help people is the correct, coherent view.
		-   "directions to which any epistemic agent can **conform**"

	-   Another approach is the **infallible guidance** approach,
		that the right rules will infallibly lead a subject to truth.

### Internalism and Inferential Rules

>   **(INF)**   If agent *S* has beliefs in propositions *K*, *L*, *M*, *N* (at time *t*), 
>   and proposition *P* is logically entailed by the conjunction of *K*, *L*, *M*, *N*,
>   then *S* is permitted (at time *t*) to believe *P*.

-   So what about beliefs that *S* holds but doesn't have access to at
	time *t* but still uses to form the belief that *P*.
	-   All the time in science, portions of problems are abstracted
		and ignored for the sake of being able to get work done.
	-   If challenged, *of course* the subject believes that portion
		of the body of evidence supporting *P*, but the subject doesn't
		necessarily need that support to form the belief that *P*.
	-   It's not that it would suffice not to have this proposition,
		say *M*, it's just that it's not necessary.
	-   Goldman writes that internalism is vindicated only when all
		justifiers are internal, which is a definition, but is this
		type of doxastic attitude or propositional support captured by 
		internal or external?

-   **(INF\*)** adds the condition of the belief being justified,
	because it's not enough that the belief be a belief.
	-   Justification comes from an external source, 
		
### Questions

1.  "we can say that a doxastic attitude toward a proposition is justified just in case it conforms to what is permitted by correct epistemic rules and unjustified in case it doesn’t conform to such rules"
This reads like a default application of normativity to epistemology, but then you write, "If S's circumstances include the possession of a certain body of evidence relevant to P, then the correct rules may permit S to believe P."
	-   This uses an account of justification.
	-   I don't understand how body of evidence got into this formulation. I think that evidentialists might like this formulation, but it could just as easily be something like, "If S's circumstances include the possession of a certain belief-forming process relevant to P, then the correct rules may permit S to believe P." 
	-   Is there any reason that you used this language? A neutral application would be, "If S's doxastic attitude towards a proposition P conforms to what is permitted by correct epistemic rules, then it is justified."
	-   This would allow a normative evaluation of epistemology to remain agnostic about the correct account of justification.
2.  I noticed that the chapter was devoted largely to the reasons that internalism cannot work, (I think) largely because justification comes in some way from the truth of the proposition, and this is not accessible in any of the right ways. I see that externalism is the rejection of internalism, and so therefore any refutation of internalism makes externalism more compelling, but I still believe that we need independently good and compelling reasons to be an externalist.
3.  Are there any coherent and compelling compatiblist positions about the internalism/externalism debate? From the reading, I understand that many necessary types of justification are best understood as external and that the chapter doesn't think there are no internal factors, but I don't see why one needs to be more prominent than the other. Justification's link to the truth and normative epistemic rules are clearly external factors, but an agent's access and conformity is, very generally, part of a process which ends internally.

-------------------------------------------

### Organizational

-   Next week we begin the knowledge portion of the course.
-   This is the longest of the three knowledge chapters.
-   Two sessions on this chapter.
-   For chapter 5, the first half of the chapter and 1 extra reading,
	and that's posted.
	-   Nozick.

### Internalism

-   It's important for internalism that the evidence for a belief
	be possessed at time of the belief forming, decision making.
	-   Goldman is not shooting at a straw man with this restrictive
		time.
	-   Sometimes counterexamples and debates turn onto a feature of
		internalism instead of the primary feature.

-   Why is process reliablism externalism?
	-   What processes? Belief forming processes.
		-   This is internal.

	-   What reliablism? Reliablism to the truth.
		-   This is external.

### Questions

-   "Background belief-forming processes"
-   Standing belief, "dispositional"

> If agent S has justified beliefs in propositions K, L,
> M, N (at time t), and S thinks that proposition P is logically 
> entailed by the conjunction of K, L, M, N, then S is permitted 
> (**at** time t) to believe P.

-   I think a better rule would be *from* time *t* **onward**.
	-   I do not think you need the justifying beliefs to be standing,
		because that would be too strong.

### Presentation

-   Connee and Feldman give examples for internalism because it's
	"good" to believe that one persons belief is better justified than
	another belief.
	-   In the example of Bob and Ray, what makes internalism compelling
		is that Bob went outside and "internalized" the external
		justification from the newspaper.
	-   This is a bad example because the belief is made good by
		the fact that there are *both* internal and external factors.
	-   "Best explained by"

#### Perception

-   "He perceives that *p*."
-   "Perceptual experience", which is something *in the head* from
	the eyes, ears.


September 30th, 2013 <small>Chapter 3, part I, 'Defining Knowledge'</small>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   'Know' is the eighth most commonly used verb in English. 
	-    By contrast, 'justified belief' is used much more infrequently.

-   We want a good definition of knowledge to solve the problem
	of **skepticism about knowledge**.
	-   The most common reason we want a good definition of knowedlge.
	-   Descartes' evil deceiver.
	-   Are you a brain in a vat?

### The Traditional View of Knowledge: Knowledge as JTB

-   K = JTB

#### The truth condition

-   If someone claims to know something, which we later find out to be
	false, we feel justified in complaining that they didn't know
	after all.
-   Sometimes, however, we will say things like, "I just *knew* it, but
	it wasn't so."
	-   **free indirect speech**: One can speak from the perspective 
		of someone with more limited or false information.

#### The belief condition

-   Knowledge is a matter of possessing the truth, and the sort of
	possession involved seems to be psychological.
	-   Memory and Radford cases.
		-   "Something *like* belief."

-   When you say, "I *merely* believe it.", you likely really know,
	but are concealing some information for some reason or another.

#### The justification condition

-   In the **Meno**, the **Gorgias**, the **Theatetus**, and elsewhere,
	Socrates distinguishes knowledge from right opinion.
	-   If you form lucky beliefs, they do not constitute knowledge
		because they are *unjustified*.
	-   They are degrees of justification, like chicken-sexers and 
		those with master intuition.

### The Gettier problem

-   Gettier's assumptions:
	1.  **Fallibism about justification**: A belief can be justified
		even if it is false.
	2.  **Justification closure**: If you are justified in believing
		P, P entails Q, and you (competently) deduce Q from P and accept
		Q as a result of this deduction, then you are justified in 
		believing Q.

-   With these two assumptions in place, Gettier gives two cases
	which he thinks are cases of having JTB while at the same time
	lacking knowledge.
	-   If he's right, the JTB cannot be knowledge because the
		conditions are insufficient.

-   Types of Gettier cases:
	1.  Smith, Jones, and the Job.
	2.  Sheep on the Hill
	3.  Havit and Nogot
	4.  Barn Facade Country

-   What could we *add* to JTB to avoid Gettier?
-   Some virtues we should look for in an account of knowledge:
	1.  Knowledge should satisfy closure principles under competent
		deduction.
	2.  The account should show why knowledge is valuable,
		and why it's better than true belief.
	3.  The account should enable us to why when someone knows that P,
		they can appropriate use P as a premix in their reasoning.
	4.  The account should enable us to understand how someone could
		know that P without being justified with absolute certainty
		that P.

-   In addition to justification closure, there is **knowledge closure**:
	If you know that P, P entails Q, and you (competently) deduce Q
	from P and accept Q as a result of this deduction, then you know
	Q.
	-   JTB has knowledge closure, but it isn't assured that JTB+X
		will have knowledge closure.

-   Can you deduce from your knowledge that you have hands that you
	are not a brain in a vat?
	-   Having hands entails not being a brain in a vat.
	-   If you make this deduction, does this give you knowledge that
		you *aren't* a brain in a vat?
	-   Doesn't this beg the question?
	-   The principle of knowledge closure doesn't say you come to have
		new knowledge when you make deductions.
		-   It just says that you do know the conclusions of those
			deductions.
		-   What knowledge closure denies is that you can make the
			deduction but not know the conclusion.

	-   **abominable conjunction**: “I know I have hands, and from this I infer that I’m not a BIV. But I don’t know I’m not a BIV.”

### Defeasibility

-   A quality of Gettier cases is that there is some fact which
	if the believer learned, would cause them to revise their
	beliefs.
	-   These are called **defeaters**.
	-   There is a defeater for Henry's belief that he sees a barn:
		that he is in fake barn country.
	-   There is a defeater in Gettier's Smith, Jones, and the Job
		case too, which is that Jones will not get the job.
	-   But what of *defeater defeaters*?
		-   The Grabit case.

### No False Assumptions

-   Gettier cases don't always involve reasoning from false
	premises.
-   **No false assumptions account**: To know is to have justified true
	belief that one's belief isn't based on a false assumption.
	-   What does it means to be *based* on a false assumption?
		-   your belief is based on a false assumption just if were you
			to learn that the assumption is false then you would be
			justified in giving your belief.

	-   This condition satisfies the barn facade case.
	-   The assumption may be that "things are the way they seem to
		be."

### Reliability

-   What disqualifies Gettier cases from being knowledge is to do with
	the lack of an objective connection between the subject's belief
	and the truth.
-   **Causal account**: To know is to have justified true belief such 
	that one’s belief is caused by the fact that makes it true.
-   When you see a sheep on a hill in a normal case, the sheep's being
	there *causes* you to see them which *causes* you to believe
	that there is a sheep on the hill.
	-   In the Gettier cases, however, your belief is caused by the
		sheep-shaped rock.

### Questions

1.  Reflective knowledge and appropriate reasoning.
	-   Don't use it in your reasoning unless you know it.
	-   There are some circumstances where you cannot use a piece of knowledge.
	-   What's the norm of assertion?
		-   When is it appropriate to assert something.
		-   An epistemological perspective.

2.  Defeasibility
	-   A wrinkle: two uses:
		1.  Justification defeater
		2.  Knowledge defeater

3.  Strength of conditions
	-   Is there a downside of making a knowledge-condition too strong?
		-   A condition *for* knowledge?
		-   If it ruled out many cases, if it's too strong,
			it rules out cases when it shouldn't rule them out.
		-   A bad analysis requires too much or too little,
			not getting the right prediction for knowledge.

	-   The possible solutions that McGrath suggests rules out too 
		many cases where we would like to say that we have knowedlge,
		but "wouldn't this be harmless?" …
		-   We do not need to categorize our propositions to be knowedlge
			for them to still be useful.
		-   There is something that tis smuggled in here, which you
			think knowledge has to be something we can act on.
		-   It's standard analytical terms to get sufficient
			and necessary conditions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Questions 

1. pg. 30, on safety, "To know that P is to have justified true belief such that if you were to believe that P, P would be true.” This seems dangerously close to begging the question. ‘If you were to believe that P, then P would be true.’ in use will allow me to point to cases where an agent believes a falsehood and say that what’s wrong about the false belief is that the belief is false, and the cases where the agent believes a truth and say the condition is satisfied because the belief is true. How can safety make truth somehow continent on belief?
2. pg. 30, safety continued. Furthermore, it also seems very close to being equivalent with a Williamson’s thought that knowledge is unanalyzable, because the formulation holds that we form JTBs “somehow” and it means they’re true. Do or can knowledge-firsters subscribe to safety? 
3. pg. 34, on relevant alternatives, "To know that P is to have JTB where one’s evidence rules out all the relevant alternatives to P.” Would “nearby possible worlds” be a good account of what is a relevant alternative? Admittedly, I haven’t read Lewis and I do not know how precise or supported the notion of “nearby” is.
4. pg. 4, on skeptical arguments, "Unless I know I haven’t spent my life being deceived by an evil genius, I cannot know anything about the world around me (or even about mathematics or logic).” Why does this entail? I cannot see that it does or does not, but for the argument to be compelling.
5. On skepticism, generally: I may not be able to provide justification for my not being a BIV or having an evil demon, but why does this necessarily affect my other candidates for knowledge? In “high standards contexts”, I’m satisfied in asserting something like, “It’s possible that I’m a BIV, have an evil demon, etc … and Obama is president.” The domain of the knowledge claim I’m making could be restricted to whatever is being appeared to me and true in that regard, and assume that I believe it and have valid justification. Is that too much to give up to skeptics?

>   $S$ knows that $p$ if and only if:
>   1.  $P$ is true
>   2.  $B_s p$
>   3.  $B_s p$ is **caused by** a **generally reliable**
>       belief forming process.
>   4.  There is no relevant alternative situation in which
>       $S$ would have believed $p$ (using the same process)

### Relevant Alternatives, Constrastivism, and Closure

>   **Relevant alternatives**: You know that *p* just when
>   you have a JTB that *p* and your evidences **rules
>   out** all the **relevant** alternatives to *p*.

-   **Ruling out** (RO):
	-   (RO)-**Sensitivity**: Your evidence rules out an alternative
		if and only if that if that alternative *had* obtained,
		you'd have very different evidence.
	-   (RO)-**Safety**: Your evidence rules out an alternative
		if and only if: you could not easily have had the same
		evidence while the alternative was the case.

-   **Relevance**: The relevance of an alternative *A* depends on
	the objective probability of *A*-like events given the kind
	of environment you're in and the kind of evidence you have.

>   **Knowledge closure**: 
>   If you know that *p*, and *p* entails *q*, you know *q*.

-   For knowledge closure to hold, every relevant alternative
	to *q* must be a relevant alternative to *p*.
	-   *Relevant* must be **intersective**.
		-   Blue is *intersective* because "blue book" breaks
			down into "is a book" and "is blue."
		-   Small is not intersective because "small planet"
			does not break down into "is a planet" and "is
			small."

>    **Constrastivism**: Knowledge is a three-place
>    relation between a knower, a proposition, and
>    another "contrasting" proposition.

-   Some important 'degrees' of knowing that *p* rather than
	*a*:
	1.  **Certainty**: *a* includes **all** alternatives to *p*;
	2.  **Relevance theorist's knowledge**: *a* includes
		**relevant** alternatives to *p*;
	3.  **Useful concept**: *a* includes **some** 
		alternatives to *p*;
	4.  **No knowledge**: *a* includes **no** alternatives 
		to *p*;
