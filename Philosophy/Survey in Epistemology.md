------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Concepts and Questions of Epistemology

-   Epistemology is the study of knowledge and related phenomena.
-   Why is this important?
    -   It can lead to better decisions.

-   How do we get truths? **Justification**.
    -   A justified or warranted belief is more likely to be true.
    -   A randomly or haphazardly chosen belief is less likely to be
        true.
    -   So how do we get the first?

-   What is a belief (alternatively opinion?)
    -   It is a *psychological attitude towards a proposition*.
        -   Where a proposition is (roughly) content which purports to
            be fact.

    -   To believe is to *mentally assent* to a propositions.
    -   Possible doxastic attitudes:
        1.  **Belief**, to mentally assent.
        2.  **Disbelief**, to mentally dissent.
        3.  **Suspension**, to neither assent nor dissent.

> It is widely thought that forming a belief that is reasonable,
> warranted, or justified is the best means available of forming a true
> belief

-   Epistemic evaluations are different from moral evaluations.
    -   They express evaluations on an *intellectual dimension*.

-   Truth and justification are not equivalent.
    -   Truth is purely metaphysical.
    -   It is true or false *of the world*.
    -   You can have a justified false belief.

-   Justification is one form of epsitemic evaluation, but perhaps there
    are others.
    -   For instance, rationality may be another, unique or not.

-   Some points of widespread agreement:
    1.  Knowledge implies truth;
    2.  A person must believe p, or have reasonably high credence in p,
        in order to know it;
    3.  Knowledge requires justification.

### The Epistemic Regress Problem

-   Many sources of justification are inference.
-   Justification needn't be spoken.
-   The structure of justification is a tree, where properly justified
    beliefs (nodes) inherit justification from roots
    -   With roots in truth?

-   Where does the original justification come from?
    -   This is the **regress problem**.

-   Possible solutions:
    -   **Infinitism**: An unending continuation of reasons, without
        repetition or end.\
    -   **Foundationalism**: An ending tree of reasons.
    -   **Coherentism**: A tree that loops back on itself.
    -   **Skepticism**. None of the first three solutions to the regress
        problem is satisfactory.

-   There are two types of ways of looking at justification with regards
    to time.
    -   **Synchronic**: A synchronic reason for a belief happens at the
        same time as the target belief.
    -   **Diachronic**: A diachronic reason is unavailable at the
        formation of the target belief?

### Infinitism

> Infinitism is rarely given serious consideration.

-   If justification goes back infinitely far, then we hold infinitely
    many beliefs?
    -   No human person has infinitely many beliefs.

-   Perhaps justification needn't originate anywhere.
-   What about with regards to people holding infinitely many beliefs?
    -   **Doxastic justification** is a property of existing beliefs.
    -   **Propositional justification** arises from the state or
        condition of an epistemic agent that entitles her to believe a
        proposition.

> infinitism can be interpreted as the view that there are infinitely
> many propositions (rather than beliefs) that form chains of
> inferential justification.

-   This may support foundationalism, however, because if justification
    isn't (ultimately) a doxastic attitude, then there is an end to the
    held beliefs which can serve an agent.
    -   There is no way that infinitist ghost propositions can be
        measured without making the propositions becoming beliefs.

-   "Justification is limited in RAM, unlimited in HDD storage."

### Coherentism

-   Coherentism is a minority view today, but historically important.
    -   Largely, the view *tolerates circular inference*.
    -   "Sometimes circularity is okay."

-   There are no "privileged beliefs" that are tethered to truth, but
    rather any net of self-supporting justification are valid
    epistemologically.
    -   "Justification is a circularly linked list."

-   Coherence and justifiedness are not intimately linked at all, and
    coherence and truth are similarly unlinked (thought not for the same
    reasons, justification and truth are distinct).

### Foundationalism and Basic Beliefs

> Foundationalism’s response to the regress problem says that every root
> in a tree of (successful) inferential justification terminates after
> finitely many steps.

-   Foundational beliefs have two crucial properties:
    -   The are *uninferred*;
    -   They are justified.

-   There are four questions that foundationalism must address to
	succeed:
	>   1.  Exactly what does it take for a belief to attain the status of 
	>       "justified" in an unmediated or non-inferential fashion? 
	>       What must take place or hold true of a belief to confer 
	>       on it the property of being immediately justified?  
	>   2.  Which types of belief or families of belief qualify as 
	>       immediately justified? What kinds of propositional 
	>       contents lend themselves to immediate justification?  
	>   3.  What strength of justification do immediately justified 
	>       beliefs need to attain according to foundationalism?  
	>       Must basic beliefs exhibit the highest grade of 
	>       justification, i.e., certainty, infallibility, or 
	>       incorrigibility?  Or can basic beliefs have weaker 
	>       degrees of justification while still being basic?
	>   4.  Assuming that many immediately justified beliefs are 
	>       available, does this enable epistemic agents to draw 
	>       enough reasonable inferences that they can attain a 
	>       large corpus of justified beliefs (both basic and non-basic), 
	>       enough to dispel the specter of skepticism that is 
	>       often laid at foundationalism's doorstep?

### Concepts and Questions

-   Doxastic attitudes, "Epistemic terms of appraisal"
    -   Beliefs, non-belief,
    -   Tripartite approach.
    -   What are others?
        -   Degrees of conviction
        -   "High confidence", expresses a doxastic attitude, on a range
            of attitudes.

    -   It's not like desiring, or hating.
        -   It's an attitude about truth or falsity.
        -   An "intellectual" attitude.
        -   Abstaining from being committal.

-   Are beliefs epistemic states?
    -   Lots of philosophers talk about beliefs as epistemic states.
        -   Doxastic attitudes are psychological states.
        -   Epistemic states are evaluations on intellectual dimensions.

-   "Know" is traditionally thought not to be an entirely mental state.
    -   It's partly:
        -   Having a belief.
        -   Having a justified belief.
        -   And being true.

    -   Knowledge is a "mental state plus …"
        -   Something like justification
        -   An epistemic component.

-   We never want to mix up truth and justification.
    -   Justification is limited to an epistemic or doxastic agent.
    -   Justified *for whom*?
    -   Justified *when*?

-   "You're justified in believing, but you don't."
    -   Propositional justification.

-   "You're justified in believing, and you do."

### The Regress Problem

-   An inferential regress.
-   To give a reason is to say something.
    -   You might have a reason, but not say it.

-   The skeptic thesis:
    -   We do not have as many JTBs as we think we do commonsensically.

-   If you say we're talking about doxastic justification, then yes,
    maybe we cannot have infinitely many psychological states.
    -   "Propositional justifiedness"

### Coherentism

-   Was popular in idealism (one or another) in Britain and American
    dominant.
    -   These involved people that are not read anymore.
    -   Royce, Bradley.
    -   Late 19th century.
    -   Very popular
    -   They often talk about in the kind of abstract way that
        infinitism will be defended.
    -   The methodology was much more abstract.

-   There are senses within belief.
    -   The belief *itself*, the psychological action.
    -   The belief's *content*, the proposition believed.

-   We want to distinguish between saying that "*p* is justified" and
    "*p* is justified for *S* at time *t*."
    -   The second one is okay and is precise.
    -   The first is not useful in epistemology.
    -   Propositions do not do any justification of their own,
        propositions are not justified.
        -   Beliefs *in* propositions *by* agents are justified *for
            them*.
        -   You do not get anything from propositional coherence.

-   What's the relationship between rationality and justification.
    -   There's no common practice.

-   Can coherence account for non-coherent justified beliefs?

### Foundationalism

-   Descartes thought that "basic beliefs" (new terminology) are about
    the agent's mental states.
-   Well what are basic/immediate beliefs like?
    -   Early on, beliefs about mental states.
    -   Later, beliefs from perception.

September 16th, 2013 <small>Chapter 2, part I, 'Evidentialism vs. Reliabilism'</small>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **justifier** refers to anything that helps make a belief state
    justified or unjustified.
    -   Anything that contributes to the **justificational status** of a
        target belief.

> How can one legitimately infer outward (to the external world),
> forward (to the future), and backward (to the past) from the
> indicated, very limited, data-set?

-   **Evidentialism**: all (positive or negative) justifiers of a belief
    held by epistemic agent *S* at time *t* are evidential states *S* is
    in at *t*.
    -   there must be a relation of **fittingness** that holds between
        the attitude of belief (directed at *P*) and *S*’s total
        evidential states at *t*.
    -   *X* is evidence for *Y* just in case possessing *X* enhances a
        person’s justification for believing *Y*.

> what justifies me in thinking that the fusiform gyrus of my right
> occipital cortex is being activated is that the fusiform gyrus of my
> right occipital cortex is being activated

-   **Reliablism**: Belief *B* is justified if and only *B* is produced
    by a reliable belief-forming process, i.e., a process that has a
    tendency to generate (belief) outputs with a high percentage of
    truths.

### Question time

-   Well-foundedness was introduced later by Feldman, it isn't there on
    the literature of foundationalism or coherentism. "Current-time
    slice theories." There can be no longer causal process.
    -   There was a tradition in logical positivists, that psychological
        factors do not belong in justification. Many important
        philosophers were anti-psychologistic.
        -   Influetial idea that the context of discovery, "thinking up"
            the idea, as opposed to the context of justification. The
            logic of justification or confirmation, that's one thing,
            and that's to be studied by formal logic and confirmation
            theory. Philsophy of science wing of epistemology.

    -   How you came to believe it is a psychological issue.
    -   It's be chosen because:
        1.  It's influential.
        2.  It's a nice contrast to reliablism.
            -   Fits nicely internalism/externalism.

-   The canonical way of talking about doxastic: "*p* is justified in
    *D* for *S* at *t*."
    -   *D* could be believing, disbelieving, or suspending
        justification.
    -   Does this mean *S* **does** believe it?
    -   Some people definitely think of propositional justification as
        the main type philosophers are interested in.

-   Propositional justification makes it difficult to talk about causal
    theories.
-   Propositional justification is defined in terms of doxastic, "If you
    were to hold this doxastic attitude."
-   Most epistemologists think knowledge requires justification.
    -   What type?

-   On the example of Chad and his poor reasoning
    -   I do not think that reliablism gets it right or that it's a
        problem for evidentialism.

-   Some background on evidentialist position:
    -   Evidence is always mental states
        -   There are experiential mental states.
        -   There are doxastic mental states, belief, disbelief, and
            suspension.

    -   If states fit the belief, then the belief is justified.
    -   *S* has *D* towards *p* on the basis of *E*.
    -   Just the states are not alone.
    -   It does not come from the specific case to the general.
        -   There is a problem with this generalization thing.
        -   If by virtue of the fact that Chad gets in wrong in these
            specific circumstances he is not justified in the instances
            where Chad gets it right, then this is a counterexample to
            reliablism as well. Imagine Chad gets it right for 3/4
            times. This reliably gets the truth. But he is still
            unjustified because he could have gotten it wrong. (I think,
            will expand later.)

### Presentation on Evidentialism

-   **Epistemically justified**: Doxastic attitude *D* towards propositions *p* is
    epistemically justified for *S* at *t* if and only if having *D*
    towards *p* fits the evidence *S* has at *t*.
-   **Well-foundedness**: A belief is well-founded only if:
	1.  It is justified;
	2.  It was formed based on a suitable body of evidence.

-   There are three different questions according to Conee and Feldman:
	1.  Is she epistemically responsible in believing *p*?
	2.  Is her belief that *p* well-founded?
	3.  Is her belief that *p* justified?

### Reliablism

-   What do you mean by a process?
	-   It's maybe not *wholly* mental.
	-   Does it start with the environment?
		-   "He formed the belief about the color of the fruit in
			queer light." 

	-   Uncle Floyd and Niece Sally
		-   Niece Sally believes Uncle Floyd, it starts with her
			auditory system, it begins with the input to the auditory
			system. Start from the inner ear? And then go into the neuro-processing
			of the ear. 
		-   Perhaps it begins with what the person says.
		-   Goldman likes to keep the process on the inside, "skin in."

-    There are **belief-independent processes** and **belief-dependent processes**
