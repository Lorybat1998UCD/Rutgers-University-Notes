### The Concepts and Questions of Epistemology

-   Epistemology is the study of knowledge and related phenomena.
-   Why is this important?
	-   It can lead to better decisions.

-   How do we get truths? **Justification**.
	-   A justified or warranted belief is more likely to be true.
	-   A randomly or haphazardly chosen belief is less likely to be true.
	-   So how do we get the first?

-   What is a belief (alternatively opinion?)
	-   It is a *psychological attitude towards a proposition*.
		-   Where a proposition is (roughly) content which purports to be fact.

	-   To believe is to *mentally assent* to a propositions.
	-   Possible doxastic attitudes:
		1.  **Belief**, to mentally assent.
		2.  **Disbelief**, to mentally dissent.
		3.  **Suspension**, to neither assent nor dissent.

> It is widely thought that forming a belief that is reasonable, warranted, or justified is the best means available of forming a true belief

-   Epistemic evaluations are different from moral evaluations.
	-   They express evaluations on an *intellectual dimension*.

-   Truth and justification are not equivalent.
	-   Truth is purely metaphysical.
	-   It is true or false *of the world*.
	-   You can have a justified false belief.

-   Justification is one form of epsitemic evaluation, but perhaps there are others.
	-   For instance, rationality may be another, unique or not.

-   Some points of widespread agreement:
	1.  Knowledge implies truth;
	2.  A person must believe p, or have reasonably high credence in p, in order to know it;
	3.  Knowledge requires justification.

### The Epistemic Regress Problem  

-   Many sources of justification are inference.
-   Justification needn't be spoken.
-   The structure of justification is a tree, where properly
	justified beliefs (nodes) inherit justification from roots
	-   With roots in truth?
-   Where does the original justification come from?
	-   This is the **regress problem**.

-   Possible solutions:
	-   **Infinitism**: An unending continuation of reasons, without repetition or end.  	-   **Foundationalism**: An ending tree of reasons.	-   **Coherentism**: A tree that loops back on itself.	-   **Skepticism**. None of the first three solutions to the regress problem is satisfactory. 

-   There are two types of ways of looking at justification
	with regards to time.
	-   **Synchronic**: A synchronic reason for a belief happens
		at the same time as the target belief.
	-   **Diachronic**: A diachronic reason is unavailable at the
		formation of the target belief?

### Infinitism

> Infinitism is rarely given serious consideration. 

-   If justification goes back infinitely far, then we hold infinitely
	many beliefs?
	-   No human person has infinitely many beliefs.

-   Perhaps justification needn't originate anywhere.
-   What about with regards to people holding infinitely many beliefs?
	-   **Doxastic justification** is a property of existing beliefs.
	-   **Propositional justification** arises from the state or 
		condition of an epistemic agent that entitles her to believe
		a proposition.

>   infinitism can be interpreted as the view that there are infinitely many propositions (rather than beliefs) that form chains of inferential justification. 

-   This may support foundationalism, however, because if justification
	isn't (ultimately) a doxastic attitude, then there is an end to 
	the held beliefs which can serve an agent.
	-   There is no way that infinitist ghost propositions can be 
		measured without making the propositions becoming
		beliefs.

-   "Justification is limited in RAM, unlimited in HDD storage."

### Coherentism

-   Coherentism is a minority view today, but historically important.
	-   Largely, the view *tolerates circular inference*.
	-   "Sometimes circularity is okay."

-   There are no "privileged beliefs" that are tethered to truth,
	but rather any net of self-supporting justification are valid
	epistemologically. 
	-   "Justification is a circularly linked list."

-   Coherence and justifiedness are not intimately linked at all,
	and coherence and truth are similarly unlinked (thought not
	for the same reasons, justification and truth are distinct).

### Foundationalism and Basic Beliefs>   Foundationalism’s response to the regress problem says that every root in a tree of (successful) inferential justification terminates after finitely many steps.

-   Foundational beliefs have two crucial properties:
	-   The are *uninferred*;
	-   They are justified.

-   There are four questions that foundationalism must address to
	succeed:
	>   1.  Exactly what does it take for a belief to attain the status of "justified" in an unmediated or non-inferential fashion? What must take place or hold true of a belief to confer on it the property of being immediately justified?  
	>   2.  Which types of belief or families of belief qualify as immediately justified? What kinds of propositional contents lend themselves to immediate justification?  
	>   3.  What strength of justification do immediately justified beliefs need to attain according to foundationalism?  Must basic beliefs exhibit the highest grade of justification, i.e., certainty, infallibility, or incorrigibility?  Or can basic beliefs have weaker degrees of justification while still being basic?
	>   4.  Assuming that many immediately justified beliefs are available, does this enable epistemic agents to draw enough reasonable inferences that they can attain a large corpus of justified beliefs (both basic and non-basic), enough to dispel the specter of skepticism that is often laid at foundationalism's doorstep?

### Concepts and Questions

-   Doxastic attitudes, "Epistemic terms of appraisal"
	-   Beliefs, non-belief, 
	-   Tripartite approach.
	-   What are others?
		-   Degrees of conviction
		-   "High confidence", expresses a doxastic attitude,
			on a range of attitudes.
	
	-   It's not like desiring, or hating.
		-   It's an attitude about truth or falsity.
		-   An "intellectual" attitude.
		-   Abstaining from being committal.

-   Are beliefs epistemic states?
	-   Lots of philosophers talk about beliefs as epistemic states.
		-   Doxastic attitudes are psychological states.
		-   Epistemic states are evaluations on intellectual dimensions.

-   "Know" is traditionally thought not to be an entirely mental state.
	-   It's partly:
		- Having a belief.
		- Having a justified belief.
		- And being true.

	-   Knowledge is a "mental state plus …"
		-   Something like justification
		-   An epistemic component.

-   We never want to mix up truth and justification.
	-   Justification is limited to an epistemic or doxastic agent.
	-   Justified *for whom*?
	-   Justified *when*?-   "You're justified in believing, but you don't."
	-   Propositional justification.

-   "You're justified in believing, and you do."

### The Regress Problem

-   An inferential regress.
-   To give a reason is to say something.
	-   You might have a reason, but not say it.

-   The skeptic thesis:
	-   We do not have as many JTBs as we think we do commonsensically.

-   If you say we're talking about doxastic justification, then
	yes, maybe we cannot have infinitely many psychological states.
	-   "Propositional justifiedness"


### Coherentism

-   Was popular in idealism (one or another) in Britain and American
	dominant.
	-   These involved people that are not read anymore.
	-   Royce, Bradley.
	-   Late 19th century.
	-   Very popular
	-   They often talk about in the kind of abstract way that
		infinitism will be defended.
	-   The methodology was much more abstract.

-   There are senses within belief.
	-   The belief *itself*, the psychological action.
	-   The belief's *content*, the proposition believed.

-   We want to distinguish between saying that "*p* is justified"
	and "*p* is justified for *S* at time *t*."
	-   The second one is okay and is precise.
	-   The first is not useful in epistemology.
	-   Propositions do not do any justification of their own,
		propositions are not justified.
		-   Beliefs *in* propositions *by* agents are justified
			*for them*.
		-   You do not get anything from propositional coherence.

-   What's the relationship between rationality and justification.
	-   There's no common practice.

-   Can coherence account for non-coherent justified beliefs?

### Foundationalism

-   Descartes thought that "basic beliefs" (new terminology) are about
	the agent's mental states.
-   Well what are basic/immediate beliefs like?
	-   Early on, beliefs about mental states.
	-   Later, beliefs from perception.
