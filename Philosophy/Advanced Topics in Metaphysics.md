### Meta

-   New Work of Universals
-   No Work on Universals
-   Humean Supervinience, Brian Weatherson
-   Philosophical Papers, David Lewis

### On Lewis

-   People say that he is the major metaphysician of the 20th century.
-   Pretty standard view of metaphysics, trying to figure out what
    exists in a general way.

-   What exists "is like."
-   What Aristotle was doing.
-   For Lewis, would could be and what is are very related.
-   He is most famous for his realism about possible worlds.
-   What makes something part of the same world?
    -   Spatio-temporal relations

-   How are worlds specified? If you're making worlds, what're you
    doing?

    -   You make a spatio-temporal manifold/structure.
    -   You need to fill it up with perfectly natural properties in
        spots.

    -   Natural properties and natural relations.
    -   You can think of it as being "decorated."

-   If you're going to specify spatio-temporal structure, what're you
    going to do?

    -   Points and metrics on the points.
    -   People have thought about physics without points.
    -   The more he says about possible worlds, the fewer possibilities
        there are.

-   Possible worlds have this structure of natural properties and
    particulars.

    -   He thought natural properties were the job of physics.
    -   What is it about the nature of physics that it's related to
        natural properties?

-   If you made a gigantic list of things that exist, some of those
    things would be possible worlds.

    -   What is it for one thing to be reduced to another?

-   Physics has the job of what is *actually instantiated*.
    -   Mosaic of natural properties is what things actually reduced to.
    -   Lewis' general metaphysics is a scientific metaphysics.

-   In the philosophy community, the realism about possible worlds was
    greeted with "incredulous stares."

-   We're interested in his views about "nomological varieties."
    -   We're interested in his account of laws, which is the Best
        Systems Account.

    -   Which hinges on his account of objective chance.

> Objective probability is one of the must *useful* tools in the natural
> sciences, but we have no idea what it is.

-   He uses this account to give an account of counterfactuals, and
    these play a gigantically big role in his account of everything
    else.

    -   Nelson Goodman, "Fact, Fiction, or Forecast"

-   In showing that something is sufficient in trying to indentify the
    laws is by looking at instances, at their role.

    -   This is a reductive enterprise.

### On Laws

-   What was background for Prof. Loewer and what's background for us,
    those he's teaching, is different.

    -   When he went to graduate school, the idea of thinking about the
        metaphysics of laws just wasn't there.

    -   There were pragmatic or semantic accounts of laws, but about
        asking the general way of what it means to be law.

    -   Philosophers were using "law" to explain what an event is.
        -   He made use of the idea of law with reference to Goodman on
            laws.

    -   The way that Lewis got people to think about metaphysics just
        wasn't on the table.

-   In recent times, "What is a law?" was put right on the table by
    Dretske and Armstrong in the 70s and 80s.

    -   No one has written a history of the scientific account of laws.

-   Hume thought that laws were sentences that applied in a certain way
    (pragmatic).

-   Ayer had a non-factual view.
-   Hempel and "positive instances of a general law confirm it."
-   What are laws? They are of the form:

    \$\$(x)(Fx \\to Gx)\$\$

    -   If you open a textbook in classical or quantum mechanics, you
        will no longer see sentences of this form.

    -   How damaging is this to their project?

-   Loewer's introduction to philosophy was when he was Amherst College
    and he wanted to date someone who thought a date was going to a talk
    by Max Black.

-   What is it to be "law-like" and what is the nature of law?
-   Hempel's paradox or the Raven paradox.
    -   How do we understand "confirms"?

-   If you have a paradox, you can say that a premise is bad, the
    reasoning form the premises is bad, or you accept the conclusion.

> If something is worth doing, it's worth doing wrong the first time.

<!-- -->


> There's less than meets the eye to Goodman's paradox.

-   Laws are very special projections.
-   Later, many philosophers adopted Goodman's language.
    -   A law is a generalation, but not any generalation.
    -   Only predicates that pick out *natural properties*.

-   There's a relationship of support between laws and counterfactuals.
    -   This is *at least* epistemological because if we know the law,
        we know the counterfactual. But the truth of the counterfactual
        doesn't mean the law is true.

-   How can a regularity explain anything?
    -   This is the really err intution.
    -   A regularity like all Fs are Gs.
    -   A law explains *why* something is true.
    -   Is the law doing the explaining?
    -   It's certainly an idea that people like Dretske and Hempel.

-   An explanation is a law along with an initial condition.
-   Armstrong thought that laws were some other part of reality, and
    they took from Goodman that the predicates must refer to certain
    kinds of properties.

    -   Gru does not pick out a universal.
    -   Does Armstrong think that Green is a universal?
    -   A universal is supposed to, those features that are the things
        that have them are exactly similar to one another.

    -   From the point of view of the science of color ...

-   For things to be an electron, it's a natural kind, universal.
-   An obvious consequence of the powers side is that if laws are things
    that cannot help but be instantiated.

    -   All the people Loewer knows think that when there are these
        powers there are these metaphysical connections, if they don't
        hold this they have to explain what these connections are.

    -   Metaphysically necessary connections.

-   Shoemaker thinks that there is only one possible world -- this one.
    -   All truths are necessary truths.

-   Take a look a Salmon about Humean and nonHumean.

### Next time

-   Step back to talk about Lewis
-   New Work on the Theory of Unverisals

January 30th, 2014 <small>Reading</small>
-----------------------------------------

### "New Work for a Theory of Universals" <small>by David Lewis</small>

#### Introduction

-   The "compulsory question" for systematic philosophy: the question of
    one over many.

    -   D.M. Armstrong thinks the answer is a theory of universals, but
        Lewis doesn't.

    -   But universal *can* do other things.

-   Although universals may be dispensible.
-   Lewis' ontology consists of *posibilia*.
    -   Along with the "iterative hierarchy of classes built upon them."

    -   Properties are not much like universals, and they cannot do the
        work of universals.

Posibilia
:   Particular, individual things, some of which comprise our actual
    world and other of which are unactualised.

-   Are universals better emplyed as a replacement for posibilia in
    Lewis' metaphysics?

    -   Not to be considered in this paper.

-   In the next section, Lewis will sketch Armstrong's theory of
    universals, constrasting them with properties understood as *classes
    of posibilia*.

    -   Then, he will say why the "One over Many" argument is
        unconvincing.

    -   Then, how universals help him in connection with the topics of:

        -   Duplication
        -   Supervenience
        -   Divergent worlds
        -   Minimal form for materialism
        -   Laws and causation
        -   Content of language and thought

    -   And perhaps the list could be extended

#### Universals and Properties

-   Language offers several more or less interchangable words, that is
    "universal" and "property" and "quality" and "attribute" ...

    -   Also "characteristic" and "kind" and "sort" and "type."

Universal
:   Those entities, if such there be, that mostly conform to Armstrong's
    account.

Property
:   Classes, any classes, but formemost classes of things.

:   To be a member of a class.

-   *Why call them **properties** as well as **classes**?*
    -   They do not need to be classes of *actual* things.
    -   The property of being a donkey is the class of *all* the
        donkeys.

Relation
:   Arbitrary classes of ordered pairs, triples, ... A relation among
    things is a property of tuples of things. With no restriction to
    actual things.

-   Universals and properties are different in two ways.
    1.  Their instantiation
        -   It is a contituent part of each particular that has it.
        -   A property is "spread around."

        > The property of being a donkey is partyly present wherever
        > there is a donkey, in this or any other world. Far from the
        > property being part of the donkey, it is closer to the truth
        > to say that the donkey is part of the property. But the
        > precise truth, rather, is that the donkey is a member of the
        > property.

        -   Thus universals would unify reality in a way that properties
            do not.

        -   Things that share a universal have not just joined a single
            class. They literally have something in common. They are not
            entirely distinct. They overlap.

        -   Universals defy intuitive principles. \*The intuitions were
            made for particulars\*.

        -   *Is copresense transitive?* **No**.

        > Round, silver, golden. Silver and round are copresent, for
        > here is a silver coin. Golden and round are copresent, for
        > there is a round coin; but silver and golden are no copresent.

    2.  Their abundance. This is the difference that qualifies for
        different work.

        -   Universal are sparse in Armstrong's work. \*There are the
            universals that that there must be to ground the
            resemblences and causal powers of things, and there is no
            reason to believe in any more.\* These would be rejected:

            1.  Not golden
            2.  Golden or wooden
            3.  Metallic
            4.  Self-identical
            5.  Owned by Fred
            6.  Belonging to class *C*
            7.  Grue
            8.  First examined before 2000 A.D.
            9.  Being identical
            10. Being alike in some respect
            11. Being exactly alike
            12. Being part of
            13. Owning
            14. Being paired with by some part in *R*

        -   The world's universals should comprise of a minimal basis
            for characterizing the world completely.

        -   Universals that do not contribute to this or are redundant
            are unwelcome.

        -   \*A non-linguistic counterpart of a primitavely vocabulary
            for a language capable of describing the world
            exhaustively.\*

Copresent
:   Two entities are *copresent* if both are wholly present at one
    position in space and time.

-   It is quite different for *properties*.
    -   Any class of things, regardless of characteristic of the class,
        is a property.

        -   So they are of immense abundance.

    -   \*\*There are so many properties that those specifiable in
        English, or in the brain's language of synaptic interconnections
        and neural spikes, could be only an infitesimal minority.\*\*

-   There so many properties that any two things share an infinite
    amount of properties and fail to share inifitely many as well.

    -   This is so whether the two things are duplicates or utterly
        dissimilar.

        -   Properties do not capture resemblence.

    -   Properties are causally irrelevant.
    -   Properties "carve reality at the joints."

Natural properties
:   Properties whose sharing makes for resemblance, and the ones
    relevant to causal powers.

Perfectly natural properties
:   If the members of the class are all and only those things that share
    some one universal.

-   An *adequate* theory of propeties is one that recognizes an
    objective difference between natural and unnatural properties.

-   A Nominalistic theory of properties could achieve adequacy by
    drawing primitive distinctions between particulars.

-   A Nominalist in pursuit of adequacy might prefer to rest with
    primitive objective resemblance among things.

Nominalism
:   the doctrine that universals or general ideas are mere names without
    any corresponding reality, and that only particular objects exist;
    properties, numbers, and sets are thought of as merely features of
    the way of considering the things that exist.

-   At this point, it could be a good idea to believe in universals \*as
    well as\* properties.

    -   "Properties have work of their own, and universals are
        ill-suited to do the work of properties."

-   Consider these sentences:
    1.  Red resembles organge more than it resembles blue.
    2.  Red is a color.
    3.  Humility is a virtue.
    4.  Redness is a sign of ripeness.

    *Prima facie*, these sentences contain names to denote individual
    things.

-   It is unlikely that there are universals for colors, especially
    particular colors.

    -   Unless you subject the phrases to paraphrasing.

-   Let *x* range over things, *P* over properties (classes) of things.
    Then:

    \$\$\\exist\_1 P \\Box \\forall x (x \\in P \\equiv 0x)\$\$

#### One Over Many

-   Armstrong's main argument is the "One over Many" argument.
    -   It is *because* that Lewis finds this unsatisfactory that he is
        seeking alternatives.

-   An effort at systemic philosophy must give an account of purpoted
    fact.

    -   There are three ways:
        1.  I deny it.
        2.  I analyse it thus ... .
        3.  I accept it as primitive.

Moorean fact
:   one of those things that we know better than we know the premises of
    any philosophical argument to the contrary

-   An adequate Nominalism is a theory that takes Moorean facts of
    apparent sameness of a type as primitive.

    -   Universals are one possible solution, but not the only, and not
        even the best (?).

-   Early in *Universals* it "undergoes an unfortunate double
    transformation."
    -   The *analysandum* becomes the schema:

        > *a* has the property *F*.

    -   The turning point takes only two sentences:

        > How is [the Nominalist] to account for the apparent (if
        > usually partial) identity of numerically different
        > particulars? How can two different things both be white or
        > both be on a table?

        -   "There are no universals but the proposition *a* is *F* is
            perfectly alright as it is." (Dodging the question.)

-   **Class Nominalism** fails because it employs predications of class
    membership, which predications it cannot without circularity analyze
    in terms of class membership.

-   **Resemblance Nominalism** fails to analyze predications of
    resemblance.
-   Predications of particpation evade analysis.

#### Duplication, Supervinience, and Divergent Worlds

-   From now on, they'll only be natural, unnatural, or more-or-less
    natural properties.

-   Beginning the analysis with *duplication*.

##### Duplication

Duplication
:   Ex, uing a copying machine. A perfect copier would make the two
    items the same in terms of atomic structure, making the two items,
    the copy and the original, indiscernible.

:   Two things are duplicates if and only if they have precisely the
    same intrinsic properties, however much their extrinisic properties
    might differ.

Intrinsic property
:   Property *P* is instrinsic if and only if, for any two duplicate
    things, not necessarily from the same world, either both have *P* or
    neither does.

Extrinsic property
:   Property *P* is extrinsic if and only in there is some such pair of
    duplicates of which one has *P* and the other lacks *P*.

-   If we relied on physical theory to be accurate and exhaustive, we
    might define duplication in physical terms.

    -   But this definition is no analysis because it presupposes the
        contigent physics of this actual world.

-   Duplication is better analyzed in terms of *shared properties*.
    -   To begin with *natural properties* and then move to *intrinsic
        properties*.

-   If Materialism were false and physics an utter failures, as it is in
    some deplorable worlds, there would still be duplication in terms of
    *shared natural properties*.

-   All *perfectly natural properties* are *intrinsic properties*.
    -   However, intrinsic properties can be disjunctive and
        miscellaneous and unnatural, so long as they never differ
        between duplicates.

-   Duplication is important for two topics in metaphysics:
    supervenience and divergent worlds.

##### Supervenience

-   A supervenience thesis is a denial of indepedant variation.
    -   It can be defined with *posibilia*.
    -   To say that so-and-so supervenes on such-and-such is to stay
        there can be no idefference in respect to so-and-so without
        difference in respect to such-and-such.

        > Beauty of statues supervenes on their shape, size, and colour,
        > for instance, if no two statures, in the same or different
        > worlds, ever differ in beauty without also differing in shape
        > or size or colour.

-   A supervenience thesis is cautiously reductionist.
-   The worst that can happen is that an ascription of a supervenient
    property is equivilent to an uncountably infinite disjunction of
    maximally specfic descriptions of the other property.

Local duplicates
:   Two worlds are *local duplicates* just in case they are divisible
    into corresponding small parts in such that that: 1. Corresponding
    parts of the two worlds are duplicates, and 2. The correspondence
    preserves spatiotemporal relations.

##### Divergent worlds

Diverge
:   Two possible worlds *diverage* just in case they are not duplicates
    but they do duplicate initial temporal segmant. For example, our
    world and another might match perfectly up through the year 1945,
    and go their separate ways thereafter.

Branching
:   Instead of duplicate segments, one and the same initial segment is
    allegedly share as a common part of two overlapping worlds.

Determinism
:   A system of laws of nature is Determinsitic just in case no two
    divergent worlds both conform perfectly to the laws of that system.

:   A world is Deterministic just in case its laws comprise a
    Determinsitic system.

:   Determinism is the thesis that our world is Deterministic.

#### Minimal Materialism

-   There is a difficulty in definining reductionist views as
    supervenience theses.

    -   The solution is to employ *natural properties* not only by way
        of *duplication* but in a *more direct way* also.

Materialism
:   The these that physics is a comprehensive theory of the world,
    complete as well as correct.

:   The world is as physics says it is, and there's no more to say.

:   Materialism is not a thesis of finite translatability of all our
    language into the language of physics.

:   Materialism is not to be indentified with any one Materialist theory
    of mind. It is a thesis that motivates a varity of theories of mind:

    -   Behaviorism
    -   Functionalism
    -   The mind-body identity theory
    -   Mind is a mistake

:   Materialism is not just the theory that there are no things except
    those things indentified by physics. Materialism *don't* believe in
    spirit, or other such nonphysical things.

:   Materialism is at least in part the thesis that there are no natural
    properties instantiated at our world except those recognized by
    physics. Couldn't ther be a natural property *X* which is shared by
    the physical brains in worlds like ours and the immaterial spirits
    that inhabit other worlds? Or by thisworldy quarks and otherwordly
    particles that cannot exist under our physics?

:   > **(M1)**: Any two possible worlds that are exactly alike in all
    > respects recognized by physics are qualitative duplicates.

    -   This will not do. A world could differ in having Materialism
        false, as it is contigent and non-physical, and then you could
        have epiphenomenal spirits and not differ physically by not be a
        qualititative duplicate.

:   > **(M2)**: There is no differe, *a fortiori* no mental difference,
    > without some nonmental difference. Any two worlds alike in all
    > nonmental respect are duplicate, and in particular do not differ
    > in respect of the mental lives of their inhabitants.

    -   This fails, I think, because worlds can differ in the mental
        lives of the inhabitants but be physically identical (?).

:   > **(M3)**: No two Materialistic worlds differ without differing
    > physically; any two Materialistic worlds that are exactly alike
    > physically are duplicates.

    -   Any world, however spirit=ridden, belongs to such a class.

:   > **(M4)**: Among worlds that conform to the actual laws of nature, no
    > two differ without differing physically; any two worlds that are
    > exactly alike physically are duplicates.

    -   Less that Materialism because M4 could hold a world where
        Materialism is false but where spiritual phenomena are
        correlated with physical phenomena accords to strict laws.

    -   More than Materialism because M\$ fails to hold at a
        Materialistic, spirit-free world if the laws of the world do not
        preculd the existence of epiphenomenal spirts. "Absent, but not
        outlawed."

:   > **(M5)**: Among worlds where no natural properties are alien to our
    > world are instantiated, no two differ without differing
    > physically; any two such worlds that are exactly alike physically
    > are duplicated.

Alien property
:   A property is *alien* to a world just in case:

    1.  It is not instantiated by any inhabitant of that world;
    2.  It is not analysable as a conjunction of, or as a structural
        property constractu out of, natural properties all of which are
        instantiated by inhabitants of that world.

#### Laws and Causation

##### Laws

-   **What is it to be a law of nature?**
    -   You need universals, or at least natural properties, to explain
        lawhood.

-   Armstrong's theory holds that what makes regularities lawful are
    second-order state of affais *N(F,G)* in which the two ordinary,
    first-order universals *F* and *G* are related by a certain dyadic
    second-order universal *N*.

    -   The "lawmaker" *N*.

    > But I say that N deserves the name of 'necessitation' only if,
    > somehow, it really can enter into the requisite necessary
    > connections. It can't enter into them just by bearing a name, any
    > more than one can have mighty biceps just by being called
    > 'Armstrong'.

-   Necessary connection can be unintelligible even when they are
    supposed to obtain between existences that are not clearly and
    wholly distinct.

-   Some regularity is accidental, but laws are regularities.
    -   So we must be selective.
    -   Reject "lawlikeness" plus truth.
    -   A suitabl system has:
        -   The virtues we aspire to in "our own theory-building."
        -   Has them to the greatest extent possible.
        -   Must be entirely true.
        -   It must be closed under strict implication.
        -   It must be as simple in axiomatisation as it can be without
            sacrificing to much information content.

        -   It must have as much information content as it can without
            sacrificing too much simplicity.

    -   The ideal system need not consist entirely of regularities,
        particular facts may gain entry if they contribute enough to
        collective simplicity and strength.

##### Causation

-   Causation involves laws
-   We need the kind of counterfactuals that avoid backtracking
-   Causation holds between events.
    -   If you put butter on the skillet, it melts, what causes this?
        -   There is one event that we can call a moving of molecules.

-   Heat is that phemonemon.
    -   It occurs in virtue of two facts:
        1.  That the skillet's molecules are moving rapidly.
        2.  That the region in question is part of a world where
            molecular motion is what occupies the heat-role.

### Introduction

-   Next week, Armstrong

> 1.  What is a law?
> 2.  What are fundamental properties?

-   Both of these question involve "what is at issue" and "is
    there a fact of the matter?" and "what's the methodology?"

### Presentation on "New Work for a Theory of Universals"

#### Set Up

Armstrong

:   Accept an entity "wholly present whereever it is instantiated"
    that's a "constituent part ... of each particular that has it."
    Accept universals! Universals make for *objective similarity* 
    and *unify reality* - Similar things *literally* overlap.

Lewis

:   Has *possibilia* and *classes of possibilia*
