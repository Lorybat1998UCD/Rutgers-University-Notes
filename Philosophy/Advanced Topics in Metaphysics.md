### Meta

-   New Work of Universals 
-   No Work on Universals 
-   Humean Supervinience, Brian Weatherson
-   Philosophical Papers, David Lewis

### On Lewis

-   People say that he is the major metaphysician of the 20th century.
-   Pretty standard view of metaphysics, trying to figure out what
    exists in a general way.
-   What exists "is like."
-   What Aristotle was doing.
-   For Lewis, would could be and what is are very related.
-   He is most famous for his realism about possible worlds.
-   What makes something part of the same world?
    -   Spatio-temporal relations

-   How are worlds specified? If you're making worlds, what're you
    doing?
    -   You make a spatio-temporal manifold/structure.
    -   You need to fill it up with perfectly natural properties in
        spots.
    -   Natural properties and natural relations.
    -   You can think of it as being "decorated."

-   If you're going to specify spatio-temporal structure, what're you
    going to do?
    -   Points and metrics on the points.
    -   People have thought about physics without points.
    -   The more he says about possible worlds, the fewer possibilities
        there are.

-   Possible worlds have this structure of natural properties and
    particulars.
    -   He thought natural properties were the job of physics.
    -   What is it about the nature of physics that it's related to
        natural properties?

-   If you made a gigantic list of things that exist, some of those
    things would be possible worlds.
    -   What is it for one thing to be reduced to another?

-   Physics has the job of what is *actually instantiated*.
    -   Mosaic of natural properties is what things actually reduced to.
    -   Lewis' general metaphysics is a scientific metaphysics.

-   In the philosophy community, the realism about possible worlds was
    greeted with "incredulous stares."
-   We're interested in his views about "nomological varieties."
    -   We're interested in his account of laws, which is the Best
        Systems Account.
    -   Which hinges on his account of objective chance.

> Objective probability is one of the must *useful* tools in the natural
> sciences, but we have no idea what it is.

-   He uses this account to give an account of counterfactuals, and
    these play a gigantically big role in his account of everything
    else.
    -   Nelson Goodman, "Fact, Fiction, or Forecast"

-   In showing that something is sufficient in trying to indentify the
    laws is by looking at instances, at their role.
    -   This is a reductive enterprise.

### On Laws

-   What was background for Prof. Loewer and what's background for us,
    those he's teaching, is different.
    -   When he went to graduate school, the idea of thinking about the
        metaphysics of laws just wasn't there.
    -   There were pragmatic or semantic accounts of laws, but about
        asking the general way of what it means to be law.
    -   Philosophers were using "law" to explain what an event is.
        -   He made use of the idea of law with reference to Goodman on
            laws.

    -   The way that Lewis got people to think about metaphysics just
        wasn't on the table.

-   In recent times, "What is a law?" was put right on the table by
    Dretske and Armstrong in the 70s and 80s.
    -   No one has written a history of the scientific account of laws.

-   Hume thought that laws were sentences that applied in a certain way
    (pragmatic).
-   Ayer had a non-factual view.
-   Hempel and "positive instances of a general law confirm it."
-   What are laws? They are of the form:

    $$(x)(Fx \to Gx)$$

    -   If you open a textbook in classical or quantum mechanics, you
        will no longer see sentences of this form.
    -   How damaging is this to their project?

-   Loewer's introduction to philosophy was when he was Amherst College
    and he wanted to date someone who thought a date was going to a talk
    by Max Black.
-   What is it to be "law-like" and what is the nature of law?
-   Hempel's paradox or the Raven paradox.
    -   How do we understand "confirms"?

-   If you have a paradox, you can say that a premise is bad, the
    reasoning form the premises is bad, or you accept the conclusion.

> If something is worth doing, it's worth doing wrong the first time.

<!-- -->

> There's less than meets the eye to Goodman's paradox.

-   Laws are very special projections.
-   Later, many philosophers adopted Goodman's language.
    -   A law is a generalation, but not any generalation.
    -   Only predicates that pick out *natural properties*.

-   There's a relationship of support between laws and counterfactuals.
    -   This is *at least* epistemological because if we know the law,
        we know the counterfactual. But the truth of the counterfactual
        doesn't mean the law is true.

-   How can a regularity explain anything?
    -   This is the really err intution.
    -   A regularity like all Fs are Gs.
    -   A law explains *why* something is true.
    -   Is the law doing the explaining?
    -   It's certainly an idea that people like Dretske and Hempel.

-   An explanation is a law along with an initial condition.
-   Armstrong thought that laws were some other part of reality,
    and they took from Goodman that the predicates must refer
    to certain kinds of properties.
    -   Gru does not pick out a universal.
    -   Does Armstrong think that Green is a universal?
    -   A universal is supposed to, those features that are
        the things that have them are exactly similar to one
        another.
    -   From the point of view of the science of color ...

-   For things to be an electron, it's a natural kind, universal.
-   An obvious consequence of the powers side is that if laws are
    things that cannot help but be instantiated.
    -   All the people Loewer knows think that when there are these
        powers there are these metaphysical connections, if they don't
        hold this they have to explain what these connections are.
    -   Metaphysically necessary connections.

-   Shoemaker thinks that there is only one possible world -- this one.
    -   All truths are necessary truths.

-   Take a look a Salmon about Humean and nonHumean.

-   Step back to talk about Lewis
-   New Work on the Theory of Unverisals
