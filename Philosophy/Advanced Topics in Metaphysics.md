### Meta

-   New Work of Universals
-   No Work on Universals
-   Humean Supervinience, Brian Weatherson
-   Philosophical Papers, David Lewis

### On Lewis

-   People say that he is the major metaphysician of the 20th century.
-   Pretty standard view of metaphysics, trying to figure out what
    exists in a general way.
-   What exists "is like."
-   What Aristotle was doing.
-   For Lewis, would could be and what is are very related.
-   He is most famous for his realism about possible worlds.
-   What makes something part of the same world?
    -   Spatio-temporal relations

-   How are worlds specified? If you're making worlds, what're you
    doing?
    -   You make a spatio-temporal manifold/structure.
    -   You need to fill it up with perfectly natural properties in
        spots.
    -   Natural properties and natural relations.
    -   You can think of it as being "decorated."

-   If you're going to specify spatio-temporal structure, what're you
    going to do?
    -   Points and metrics on the points.
    -   People have thought about physics without points.
    -   The more he says about possible worlds, the fewer possibilities
        there are.

-   Possible worlds have this structure of natural properties and
    particulars.
    -   He thought natural properties were the job of physics.
    -   What is it about the nature of physics that it's related to
        natural properties?

-   If you made a gigantic list of things that exist, some of those
    things would be possible worlds.
    -   What is it for one thing to be reduced to another?

-   Physics has the job of what is *actually instantiated*.
    -   Mosaic of natural properties is what things actually reduced to.
    -   Lewis' general metaphysics is a scientific metaphysics.

-   In the philosophy community, the realism about possible worlds was
    greeted with "incredulous stares."

-   We're interested in his views about "nomological varieties."
    -   We're interested in his account of laws, which is the Best
        Systems Account.
    -   Which hinges on his account of objective chance.

> Objective probability is one of the must *useful* tools in the natural
> sciences, but we have no idea what it is.

-   He uses this account to give an account of counterfactuals, and
    these play a gigantically big role in his account of everything
    else.
    -   Nelson Goodman, "Fact, Fiction, or Forecast"

-   In showing that something is sufficient in trying to indentify the
    laws is by looking at instances, at their role.
    -   This is a reductive enterprise.

### On Laws

-   What was background for Prof. Loewer and what's background for us,
    those he's teaching, is different.
    -   When he went to graduate school, the idea of thinking about the
        metaphysics of laws just wasn't there.
    -   There were pragmatic or semantic accounts of laws, but about
        asking the general way of what it means to be law.
    -   Philosophers were using "law" to explain what an event is.
        -   He made use of the idea of law with reference to Goodman on
            laws.

-   The way that Lewis got people to think about metaphysics just
        wasn't on the table.

-   In recent times, "What is a law?" was put right on the table by
    Dretske and Armstrong in the 70s and 80s.
    -   No one has written a history of the scientific account of laws.

-   Hume thought that laws were sentences that applied in a certain way
    (pragmatic).
-   Ayer had a non-factual view.
-   Hempel and "positive instances of a general law confirm it."
-   What are laws? They are of the form:

    \$\$(x)(Fx \\to Gx)\$\$

    -   If you open a textbook in classical or quantum mechanics, you
        will no longer see sentences of this form.
    -   How damaging is this to their project?

-   Loewer's introduction to philosophy was when he was Amherst College
    and he wanted to date someone who thought a date was going to a talk
    by Max Black.
-   What is it to be "law-like" and what is the nature of law?
-   Hempel's paradox or the Raven paradox.
    -   How do we understand "confirms"?

-   If you have a paradox, you can say that a premise is bad, the
    reasoning form the premises is bad, or you accept the conclusion.

> If something is worth doing, it's worth doing wrong the first time.

<!-- -->


> There's less than meets the eye to Goodman's paradox.

-   Laws are very special projections.
-   Later, many philosophers adopted Goodman's language.
    -   A law is a generalation, but not any generalation.
    -   Only predicates that pick out *natural properties*.

-   There's a relationship of support between laws and counterfactuals.
    -   This is *at least* epistemological because if we know the law,
        we know the counterfactual. But the truth of the counterfactual
        doesn't mean the law is true.

-   How can a regularity explain anything?
    -   This is the really err intution.
    -   A regularity like all Fs are Gs.
    -   A law explains *why* something is true.
    -   Is the law doing the explaining?
    -   It's certainly an idea that people like Dretske and Hempel.

-   An explanation is a law along with an initial condition.
-   Armstrong thought that laws were some other part of reality, and
    they took from Goodman that the predicates must refer to certain
    kinds of properties.
    -   Gru does not pick out a universal.
    -   Does Armstrong think that Green is a universal?
    -   A universal is supposed to, those features that are the things
        that have them are exactly similar to one another.
    -   From the point of view of the science of color ...

-   For things to be an electron, it's a natural kind, universal.
-   An obvious consequence of the powers side is that if laws are things
    that cannot help but be instantiated.
    -   All the people Loewer knows think that when there are these
        powers there are these metaphysical connections, if they don't
        hold this they have to explain what these connections are.
    -   Metaphysically necessary connections.

-   Shoemaker thinks that there is only one possible world -- this one.
    -   All truths are necessary truths.

-   Take a look a Salmon about Humean and nonHumean.

### Next time

-   Step back to talk about Lewis
-   New Work on the Theory of Unverisals

January 30th, 2014 <small>Reading</small>
-----------------------------------------

### "New Work for a Theory of Universals" <small>by David Lewis</small>

#### Introduction

-   The "compulsory question" for systematic philosophy: the question of
    one over many.
    -   D.M. Armstrong thinks the answer is a theory of universals, but
        Lewis doesn't.
    -   But universal *can* do other things.

-   Although universals may be dispensible.
-   Lewis' ontology consists of *posibilia*.
    -   Along with the "iterative hierarchy of classes built upon them."
    -   Properties are not much like universals, and they cannot do the
        work of universals.

Posibilia
:   Particular, individual things, some of which comprise our actual
    world and other of which are unactualised.

-   Are universals better emplyed as a replacement for posibilia in
    Lewis' metaphysics?
    -   Not to be considered in this paper.

-   In the next section, Lewis will sketch Armstrong's theory of
    universals, constrasting them with properties understood as *classes
    of posibilia*.
    -   Then, he will say why the "One over Many" argument is
        unconvincing.

    -   Then, how universals help him in connection with the topics of:
        -   Duplication
        -   Supervenience
        -   Divergent worlds
        -   Minimal form for materialism
        -   Laws and causation
        -   Content of language and thought

    -   And perhaps the list could be extended

#### Universals and Properties

-   Language offers several more or less interchangable words, that is
    "universal" and "property" and "quality" and "attribute" ...
    -   Also "characteristic" and "kind" and "sort" and "type."

Universal
:   Those entities, if such there be, that mostly conform to Armstrong's
    account.

Property
:   Classes, any classes, but formemost classes of things.

:   To be a member of a class.

-   *Why call them **properties** as well as **classes**?*
    -   They do not need to be classes of *actual* things.
    -   The property of being a donkey is the class of *all* the
        donkeys.

Relation
:   Arbitrary classes of ordered pairs, triples, ... A relation among
    things is a property of tuples of things. With no restriction to
    actual things.

-   Universals and properties are different in two ways.
    1.  Their instantiation
        -   It is a contituent part of each particular that has it.
        -   A property is "spread around."

        > The property of being a donkey is partyly present wherever
        > there is a donkey, in this or any other world. Far from the
        > property being part of the donkey, it is closer to the truth
        > to say that the donkey is part of the property. But the
        > precise truth, rather, is that the donkey is a member of the
        > property.

        -   Thus universals would unify reality in a way that properties
            do not.
        -   Things that share a universal have not just joined a single
            class. They literally have something in common. They are not
            entirely distinct. They overlap.
        -   Universals defy intuitive principles. \*The intuitions were
            made for particulars\*.
        -   *Is copresense transitive?* **No**.

        > Round, silver, golden. Silver and round are copresent, for
        > here is a silver coin. Golden and round are copresent, for
        > there is a round coin; but silver and golden are no copresent.

    2.  Their abundance. This is the difference that qualifies for
        different work.

        -   Universal are sparse in Armstrong's work. \*There are the
            universals that that there must be to ground the
            resemblences and causal powers of things, and there is no
            reason to believe in any more.\* These would be rejected:
            1.  Not golden
            2.  Golden or wooden
            3.  Metallic
            4.  Self-identical
            5.  Owned by Fred
            6.  Belonging to class *C*
            7.  Grue
            8.  First examined before 2000 A.D.
            9.  Being identical
            10. Being alike in some respect
            11. Being exactly alike
            12. Being part of
            13. Owning
            14. Being paired with by some part in *R*

        -   The world's universals should comprise of a minimal basis
            for characterizing the world completely.
        -   Universals that do not contribute to this or are redundant
            are unwelcome.
        -   *A non-linguistic counterpart of a primitavely vocabulary
            for a language capable of describing the world
            exhaustively.*

Copresent
:   Two entities are *copresent* if both are wholly present at one
    position in space and time.

-   It is quite different for *properties*.
    -   Any class of things, regardless of characteristic of the class,
        is a property.
        -   So they are of immense abundance.

    -   \*\*There are so many properties that those specifiable in
        English, or in the brain's language of synaptic interconnections
        and neural spikes, could be only an infitesimal minority.\*\*

-   There so many properties that any two things share an infinite
    amount of properties and fail to share inifitely many as well.
    -   This is so whether the two things are duplicates or utterly
        dissimilar.
        -   Properties do not capture resemblence.

    -   Properties are causally irrelevant.
    -   Properties "carve reality at the joints."

Natural properties
:   Properties whose sharing makes for resemblance, and the ones
    relevant to causal powers.

Perfectly natural properties
:   If the members of the class are all and only those things that share
    some one universal.

-   An *adequate* theory of propeties is one that recognizes an
    objective difference between natural and unnatural properties.
-   A Nominalistic theory of properties could achieve adequacy by
    drawing primitive distinctions between particulars.
-   A Nominalist in pursuit of adequacy might prefer to rest with
    primitive objective resemblance among things.

Nominalism
:   the doctrine that universals or general ideas are mere names without
    any corresponding reality, and that only particular objects exist;
    properties, numbers, and sets are thought of as merely features of
    the way of considering the things that exist.

-   At this point, it could be a good idea to believe in universals \*as
    well as\* properties.
    -   "Properties have work of their own, and universals are
        ill-suited to do the work of properties."

-   Consider these sentences:
    1.  Red resembles organge more than it resembles blue.
    2.  Red is a color.
    3.  Humility is a virtue.
    4.  Redness is a sign of ripeness.

    *Prima facie*, these sentences contain names to denote individual
    things.

-   It is unlikely that there are universals for colors, especially
    particular colors.
    -   Unless you subject the phrases to paraphrasing.

-   Let *x* range over things, *P* over properties (classes) of things.
    Then:

    $$\exist_1 P \Box \forall x (x \in P \equiv 0x)$$

#### One Over Many

-   Armstrong's main argument is the "One over Many" argument.
    -   It is *because* that Lewis finds this unsatisfactory that he is
        seeking alternatives.

-   An effort at systemic philosophy must give an account of purpoted
    fact.
    -   There are three ways:
        1.  I deny it.
        2.  I analyse it thus ... .
        3.  I accept it as primitive.

Moorean fact
:   one of those things that we know better than we know the premises of
    any philosophical argument to the contrary

-   An adequate Nominalism is a theory that takes Moorean facts of
    apparent sameness of a type as primitive.
    -   Universals are one possible solution, but not the only, and not
        even the best (?).

-   Early in *Universals* it "undergoes an unfortunate double
    transformation."
    -   The *analysandum* becomes the schema:

        > *a* has the property *F*.

    -   The turning point takes only two sentences:

        > How is [the Nominalist] to account for the apparent (if
        > usually partial) identity of numerically different
        > particulars? How can two different things both be white or
        > both be on a table?

        -   "There are no universals but the proposition *a* is *F* is
            perfectly alright as it is." (Dodging the question.)

-   **Class Nominalism** fails because it employs predications of class
    membership, which predications it cannot without circularity analyze
    in terms of class membership.
-   **Resemblance Nominalism** fails to analyze predications of
    resemblance.
-   Predications of particpation evade analysis.

#### Duplication, Supervinience, and Divergent Worlds

-   From now on, they'll only be natural, unnatural, or more-or-less
    natural properties.
-   Beginning the analysis with *duplication*.

##### Duplication

Duplication
:   Ex, uing a copying machine. A perfect copier would make the two
    items the same in terms of atomic structure, making the two items,
    the copy and the original, indiscernible.

:   Two things are duplicates if and only if they have precisely the
    same intrinsic properties, however much their extrinisic properties
    might differ.

Intrinsic property
:   Property *P* is instrinsic if and only if, for any two duplicate
    things, not necessarily from the same world, either both have *P* or
    neither does.

Extrinsic property
:   Property *P* is extrinsic if and only in there is some such pair of
    duplicates of which one has *P* and the other lacks *P*.

-   If we relied on physical theory to be accurate and exhaustive, we
    might define duplication in physical terms.
    -   But this definition is no analysis because it presupposes the
        contigent physics of this actual world.

-   Duplication is better analyzed in terms of *shared properties*.
    -   To begin with *natural properties* and then move to *intrinsic
        properties*.

-   If Materialism were false and physics an utter failures, as it is in
    some deplorable worlds, there would still be duplication in terms of
    *shared natural properties*.

-   All *perfectly natural properties* are *intrinsic properties*.
    -   However, intrinsic properties can be disjunctive and
        miscellaneous and unnatural, so long as they never differ
        between duplicates.

-   Duplication is important for two topics in metaphysics:
    supervenience and divergent worlds.

##### Supervenience

-   A supervenience thesis is a denial of indepedant variation.
    -   It can be defined with *posibilia*.
    -   To say that so-and-so supervenes on such-and-such is to stay
        there can be no idefference in respect to so-and-so without
        difference in respect to such-and-such.

        > Beauty of statues supervenes on their shape, size, and colour,
        > for instance, if no two statures, in the same or different
        > worlds, ever differ in beauty without also differing in shape
        > or size or colour.

-   A supervenience thesis is cautiously reductionist.
-   The worst that can happen is that an ascription of a supervenient
    property is equivilent to an uncountably infinite disjunction of
    maximally specfic descriptions of the other property.

Local duplicates
:   Two worlds are *local duplicates* just in case they are divisible
    into corresponding small parts in such that that: 1. Corresponding
    parts of the two worlds are duplicates, and 2. The correspondence
    preserves spatiotemporal relations.

##### Divergent worlds

Diverge
:   Two possible worlds *diverage* just in case they are not duplicates
    but they do duplicate initial temporal segmant. For example, our
    world and another might match perfectly up through the year 1945,
    and go their separate ways thereafter.

Branching
:   Instead of duplicate segments, one and the same initial segment is
    allegedly share as a common part of two overlapping worlds.

Determinism
:   A system of laws of nature is Determinsitic just in case no two
    divergent worlds both conform perfectly to the laws of that system.

:   A world is Deterministic just in case its laws comprise a
    Determinsitic system.

:   Determinism is the thesis that our world is Deterministic.

#### Minimal Materialism

-   There is a difficulty in definining reductionist views as
    supervenience theses.
    -   The solution is to employ *natural properties* not only by way
        of *duplication* but in a *more direct way* also.

Materialism
:   The these that physics is a comprehensive theory of the world,
    complete as well as correct.

:   The world is as physics says it is, and there's no more to say.

:   Materialism is not a thesis of finite translatability of all our
    language into the language of physics.

:   Materialism is not to be indentified with any one Materialist theory
    of mind. It is a thesis that motivates a varity of theories of mind:

    -   Behaviorism
    -   Functionalism
    -   The mind-body identity theory
    -   Mind is a mistake

:   Materialism is not just the theory that there are no things except
    those things indentified by physics. Materialism *don't* believe in
    spirit, or other such nonphysical things.

:   Materialism is at least in part the thesis that there are no natural
    properties instantiated at our world except those recognized by
    physics. Couldn't ther be a natural property *X* which is shared by
    the physical brains in worlds like ours and the immaterial spirits
    that inhabit other worlds? Or by thisworldy quarks and otherwordly
    particles that cannot exist under our physics?

:   > **(M1)**: Any two possible worlds that are exactly alike in all
    > respects recognized by physics are qualitative duplicates.

    -   This will not do. A world could differ in having Materialism
        false, as it is contigent and non-physical, and then you could
        have epiphenomenal spirits and not differ physically by not be a
        qualititative duplicate.

:   > **(M2)**: There is no differe, *a fortiori* no mental difference,
    > without some nonmental difference. Any two worlds alike in all
    > nonmental respect are duplicate, and in particular do not differ
    > in respect of the mental lives of their inhabitants.

    -   This fails, I think, because worlds can differ in the mental
        lives of the inhabitants but be physically identical (?).

:   > **(M3)**: No two Materialistic worlds differ without differing
    > physically; any two Materialistic worlds that are exactly alike
    > physically are duplicates.

    -   Any world, however spirit=ridden, belongs to such a class.

:   > **(M4)**: Among worlds that conform to the actual laws of nature, no
    > two differ without differing physically; any two worlds that are
    > exactly alike physically are duplicates.

    -   Less that Materialism because M4 could hold a world where
        Materialism is false but where spiritual phenomena are
        correlated with physical phenomena accords to strict laws.

    -   More than Materialism because M\$ fails to hold at a
        Materialistic, spirit-free world if the laws of the world do not
        preculd the existence of epiphenomenal spirts. "Absent, but not
        outlawed."

:   > **(M5)**: Among worlds where no natural properties are alien to our
    > world are instantiated, no two differ without differing
    > physically; any two such worlds that are exactly alike physically
    > are duplicated.

Alien property
:   A property is *alien* to a world just in case:

    1.  It is not instantiated by any inhabitant of that world;
    2.  It is not analysable as a conjunction of, or as a structural
        property constractu out of, natural properties all of which are
        instantiated by inhabitants of that world.

#### Laws and Causation

##### Laws

-   **What is it to be a law of nature?**
    -   You need universals, or at least natural properties, to explain
        lawhood.

-   Armstrong's theory holds that what makes regularities lawful are
    second-order state of affais *N(F,G)* in which the two ordinary,
    first-order universals *F* and *G* are related by a certain dyadic
    second-order universal *N*.
    -   The "lawmaker" *N*.

    > But I say that N deserves the name of 'necessitation' only if,
    > somehow, it really can enter into the requisite necessary
    > connections. It can't enter into them just by bearing a name, any
    > more than one can have mighty biceps just by being called
    > 'Armstrong'.

-   Necessary connection can be unintelligible even when they are
    supposed to obtain between existences that are not clearly and
    wholly distinct.
-   Some regularity is accidental, but laws are regularities.
    -   So we must be selective.
    -   Reject "lawlikeness" plus truth.
    -   A suitabl system has:
        -   The virtues we aspire to in "our own theory-building."
        -   Has them to the greatest extent possible.
        -   Must be entirely true.
        -   It must be closed under strict implication.
        -   It must be as simple in axiomatisation as it can be without
            sacrificing to much information content.
        -   It must have as much information content as it can without
            sacrificing too much simplicity.

    -   The ideal system need not consist entirely of regularities,
        particular facts may gain entry if they contribute enough to
        collective simplicity and strength.

##### Causation

-   Causation involves laws
-   We need the kind of counterfactuals that avoid backtracking
-   Causation holds between events.
    -   If you put butter on the skillet, it melts, what causes this?
        -   There is one event that we can call a moving of molecules.

-   Heat is that phemonemon.
    -   It occurs in virtue of two facts:
        1.  That the skillet's molecules are moving rapidly.
        2.  That the region in question is part of a world where
            molecular motion is what occupies the heat-role.

### Introduction

-   Next week, Armstrong

> 1.  What is a law?
> 2.  What are fundamental properties?

-   Both of these question involve "what is at issue" and "is
    there a fact of the matter?" and "what's the methodology?"

### Presentation on "New Work for a Theory of Universals"

#### Set Up

Armstrong

:   Accept an entity "wholly present whereever it is instantiated"
    that's a "constituent part ... of each particular that has it."
    Accept universals! Universals make for *objective similarity* 
    and *unify reality* - Similar things *literally* overlap.

Lewis

:   Has *possibilia* and *classes of possibilia*

### What is Humean Supervenience?

-   Human Supervenience
    1.  **Truth supervenes on being**
        -   All the facts about the world supervene on facts about
            which individuals instantiate which fundamental properties
            and relations.
        -   This is the core part of Lew's metaphysics.
        -   Lewis thinks the fundamental properties and relations
            of the world characterize the world *without redunancy*
        -   If *earlier than* and *later than* are fundamental, then
            there is some redunadancy in the characterization of the
            world in terms of fundamental properties.
            -   But it's hard to see how one is fundamental and the other
                isn't.

        -   We'll stick to fundamental properties characterizing the
            world *completely*.

    2.  **Anti-haeccaetism**
        -   All the facts about a world supervene on the distribution of
            qualitative properties and relation.
        -   Rearranging which properties hang on which 'hooks' doesn't
            change any facts.
        -   Consider what it would be like for anti-haeccaetism to fail.
            There would have to be two worlds, with the same distribution
            of qualitative properties, but with different facts obtaining
            in each.

    3.  **Spatio-temporalism**
        -   The only fundamental relations that are actually instantiated
            are spatio-temporal, and all fundamental properties are
            properties of points or point-sized occupants of points.

#### Supervenience

Strong Modal HS

:   For any two worlds where the spatio-temporal distribution of fundamental
    qualities is the same, the contigent facts are the same.

-   It is consistent with HS that there could be *fundamental non-spatio
    temporal relations*.
    -   HS claims that there are no such relations *instantiated*.

Local Modal HS

:   For any two worlds at which no alien properties or relations are 
    instantiated, if the spatio-temporal distribution of fundamental
    qualities is the same at each world, the contigent facts are also
    the same.

-   "Enduring objects" would generate counterexamples.

Familiar Modal HS

:   For any two "worlds like ours" if the spatio-temporal distribution of
    fundamental qualities is the same at each world, the contigent facts
    are also the same.

#### What is Perfect Naturalness?

-   We do need to understand what it is to be *fundamental* and *perfectly
    natural*.

> ...two things are duplicates if and only if
> 
>   1.  they have exactly the same *perfectly natural properties*, and 
>   2.  their parts can be put into correspondence in such a way 
>       that corresponding parts have exactly the same *perfectly 
>       natural properties*, and stand in the same *perfectly 
>       natural relations*.
>
> **(Lewis, 1986a, 61)**

Perfectly natural properties

:   -   There is a small class of properties and relations such that the
        facts at any world supervene on the distribution of these properties
        and relations.
    -   Each of these properties is an intrinsic property.
    -   At the actual world, the only relations among these which are
        instantiated are spatio-temporal, and all the contigent facts 
        supervene not merely on the distribution of fundamental qualities
        and relations, but also on the distribution of fundamental qualties
        and relations *over points and point-sized occupants of points*.

#### Humean Supervenience and the other Humean Thesis

-   There are three views that Lewis endorses that can broadly
    be described as "human":
    
    HS

    :   See above.

    Nomological Reductionism

    :   Nomological properties and relations (including lawhood, chance,
        and causation) are not among the fundamental properties and
        relations.

    Modal Combinatorialism

    :   Roughly, anything can co-exist with anything else.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

#### The importantance of our topic

-   The question, "What is a law of nature" is central to philosophy
    of science.
    -   But also to epistemology and metaphysics.
    -   In this section, Amstrong will establish why it's important
        both narrowly and broadly.

-   Natural science has three tasks.
    1.  Geography and history of the universe.
        -   Taking "geography" to cover space and "history" to cover
            time.
    
    2.  Discover what sorts of thing and what sorts of property there
        are in the universe and how they are constituted.
    3.  State the laws which the things in space and time obey.

-   It may not be obvious that there is a second task to be distinguished
    from the third.
    -   Heat *is* molecular motion is not a historical or geographical
        truth.
        -   This is not a law of nature or a "bridge law"
        -   It is something different, a constituate of a property or range
            of properties in terms of more ultimate properties.

-   These three inquiries are inextricably linked.
    -   They can only be pursued in conjunction.

-   If discovery of law is of the traditional tasks of natural science,
    then the nature of a law of nature must be a central ontological
    concern for philosophy of science.
-   The question of "What is a law of nature?" has a wider and philosophical
	importance.
	-   The *only* relation that allows us to move from observed matters of
		fact to *unobserved* matters of fact is cause and effect.
		-   Without this, we cannot move beyond observation.

-   If you appeal to Hume, you can say that inferences to particular
	unobserved phenomena would be unreliable without laws of nature.
-   But you don't have to.
    -   The proposition is obvious enough in itself.
    -   The scientist trying to establish the geography and history of the
        ubobserved universe must depends on laws.
    -   When we make day-to-day inferences, it's not as important.
        -   It's still irrational to make inferences without laws.

-   Hume: "Inference from the observed to the unobserved is central to
    our whole life as humans."
    -   Without such laws, inferences would not be reliable.
    -   Hence, important question for *epistemology*.
    -   If so, we want to know about its *ontology*.
        -   We will want to know what a law *is*.

-   The view that would evade this arguments would the view that, "althought
    there are regularities in the world, there are no laws of nature."
    -   It "denies that the world contains anything except these regularities."

-   Problem with this view: What reason we can to think the world is regular.
    -   Problem of induction, too.

#### A possible difficulty in investigating our topic

> **Paradox of Analysis**: If we ask what sore of thing an X is then either
> we know what an X is or we do not. If we know, then there is no need to
> ask the question. If we do not, we have no way to begin the investigation.

-   The solution? We have a fuzzy notion and we're reflecting on it.
-   If we can securely get instances of X, you can "tie the inquiry down."
    -   If we can be sure that an *a* is an X, then we can use other things which
        we know or believe about *a* to check the proposed account of X.

-   **The Problem**: There are no secure paradigms of laws of nature.
    -   Consider contemporary natural science. It is perfectly epistemically
        possible that we dont know a single law of nature.
        -   This may be the handicap to answering the question, of what is a
            law of nature.

-   Even though we can point to no secure paradigm of laws, the scientific
    theories we now work with contain what at least some real laws of nature.
    -   If our theories do no nearly grasp the truth, we would be unable
        to explain why so many predictions are succesful.
    -   We do theoritical calculations allow us to get safely to and from the
        moon?
        -   Can hardly be mere fantasy.

    -   We can make an inference to the best explanation from the predicition
        success of contemporary science to the such theories have tolerable
        accuracy.

-   Even some pre-science laws are pretty good.
    -   Consider these examples:
        -   Fire burns
        -   Bread nourishes
        -   Water suffocates

    -   If these were not true, then we would all be dead.

-   This indicates the importance of fighting skepticism about this topic.
    -   He considers this a **reply**.

-   The secone **response** to the objection is that we know the *forms* that
    the laws take.
    -   Consider these forms that use dummies:
        1.  It is a law that Fs are Gs.
        2.  It is a law that an F has a certain probability of being a G.
        3.  It is a law that the quantities of P and Q co-vary in such a
            way that Q is  certain functino of P (Q = f(P)).

    -   We can largely proceed with these schemata.
        -   Philosophers cannot make any serious contribution to the *scientific*
            project of actually determining the laws.
        -   To every subject, its appropriate level of abstraction.

-   If concrete examples are required, there are examples in current and earlier
    science.
    -   Newton's Law is not *strictly* a law, but an approximation of a wide range
        of phenomena.
    -   It makes for a good stand-in for a law of nature.

#### Assumptions

-   **Assumption**: The truth of a Realisitic account of laws of nature.
    -   That they exist indepedantly of the minds which attempt to grasp them.

Law-statements

:   May be true or fase. If they are true, what *makes them true* is a law.

-   Behind all anti-Realist views of laws stands the RT.
    -   Regularities are the Realistic component of anti-Realist theories of laws.
        -   As a result, a destructive critique of Regularity theory will undermine
            anti-Realist theories of laws.

-   **Assumption**: On Realism about universals.
    -   Not even the Regularity theory can be developed without universals.
    -   The Realist about laws who wishes to go beyond Regularity must use 
        universals.

-   **Assumption**: Actualism

Actualism

:   We should not postualte any particulars except actual particulars, not any
    properties and relations save actual, or categorical, properties and relations.

    This debars us not from the past and future, but from using the merely possible,
    both logical and physical.

#### The Regularity Theory

-   There are many who would *like* regularity theory to be true.
    -   This influence makes it powerful.

-   In the course of the criticism, we'll see  what a good theory of laws *ought*
    to do.
-   After disposing of Regularity theory, it will be shown that any satisfactory
    account of laws must involve universals, and irreducible relations between them.


### Critique of the Regularity theory (1) <small>The problem of accidental uniformities</small>

-   Laws of nature characteristically *manifest* themselves or *issue* 
    regularity
-   Philosophers usually think of a Regularituy theory of *causation*,
    but what is considered here is a Regularity theory of *laws*.

RT of Causation

:   1.  That causal connection is a species of law-like connection.
    2.  That laws are nothing but regularities in the behavior of things.

#### The naive regularity theory of law

-   George Molnar's criticism of Regularity theory of laws
    -   Outline of a theory called RT of laws of nature, called *Naive
        Regularity* theory.
    -   He then considers an argument against such a theory, an argument
        from unrealized physical possibilities.
    -   He then argues that none of the judicious modifications in spirit
        of the theory are satisfactory.

-   But the tactic can be generalized to RT in general, not just laws.

> *p* is a **statement** of a law of nature just in case:
>
> 1.  *p* is universally quantified
> 2.  *p* is [omnitemporally and omnispatially] true
> 3.  *p* is contigent
> 4.  *p* contains only non-local empirical predicates, apart from
>     logical connectives and quantifiers.

#### Classification of ciriticisms of the RT

-   If we take "Humean uniformities" and try to identify them with "the
    laws of nature", difficulties of identification arise.
    -   There are Humean uniformities that are not laws.
        -   Being a Humean uniformity is not *sufficient* to be a law of
            nature.
        -   There are laws that do not apply at all times, there are laws
            which are probabilistic.
        -   So it's also not necessary that a law of nature be a Humean
            uniformity.

-   Even if these difficulties can be overcome, there are others.
    -   It is a law that all Fs are Gs just in case all Fs are Gs where
        the latter is a Humean regularity

-   The "intensional" difficulties are in Chapter 4.
-   Chapter 5 will Chisolm until it is clear it's not worth it.

#### Single-case uniformities

-   The laws of nature are, at best, a sub-class of the class of HUs.
    -   A recognized research programme is finding a wa to cut out the unwanted
        HUs will remaining faithful to RT.
    -   This first case is *against* Naive RT, which identifies laws and HU.

-   Probably, every object in the univers differs in its properties from
    every other object.
    -   By this, general, non-local properties.
        -   "Living in Australia" is not a property.
        -   "Being a light-second distant from proton A" is not a general
            relation property.
        -   "Being a light-second distant from a proton" would be satisfactory.
 
-   For each particular, therefore, it is likely that there exists at
    least one *individual conjunction* of properties, that is, a conjunction
    of properties.

#### How to pass from single-case uniformitie ot multi-case uniformities

-   Given a plurality of single-case HU, we can immediately construct plural-case
    HU which have no reason to believe are manifestations of laws of nature.
    -   Consider individuating conjuctions of properties A, B, and C associated
        with particulars *a*, *b*, and *c*.
        -   We can say that whenever an object is of the sort then it further has
            the property.

-   The problem of to exclude a disjunctive set of affairs is a close cousing to
    the problem introduced by Nelson Goodman with the predicates "grue" and "bleen."
    -   Suppose all things green turn blue after 2000, and all blue things green.
    -   Rlative to the predicates "green" and "blue" all things change.
    -   The problem is to say why one set of predicates should have preference over
        the other.

-   A Regularity account of laws to be developed in a Realistic way must be stipulated
    that only certain non-local predicates can be used to state "uniformities."
    -   Admissible predicates must carve reality along some join, natural,
        unified, objectively resembling class of phenomena.
        -   Otherwise these "uniformities" are not *uniformities*.

### Review of Lewis' Fundamental Ontology

-   What makes a possible world concrete?
-   What makes a possible world?
    -   Unclear: Sometimes he writes as though there spacetime points,
        sometimes he writes as though there are others.
    -   If he wrote a list:
        -   Spacetime structure
        -   Spacetime points
        -   Fields, particles

    -   His ontology becomes very *sparse*.
        -   *I guess* he's commit to a substanvilism (...)

-   Natural properties, one way of understanding them is special sets.
    -   Special in a couple ways:
        1.  Exemplifictions in all possible worlds (...)
        2.  Supervinience

-   Everything is *made true* by something in his ontology.
-   He didn't want to rule out alien, that is unconcievable, properties,
    structures, and individuals.
-   It's easy to think that the natural properties have intrinsic natures.
    -   He's open to the idea.

-   Strawson has this idea that we're *acquinted* with intrinsic natures.
    -   What's the *intrisic nature* of being a quark?
        -   For him, that is Strawson, it's an experiential argument.

Property

:   Set of *possibilia*

Possibilia

:   Possible worlds.

-   Natural relations supervene on natural properties
    -   What does Lewis say about this and extrinsic/intrinsic?
        -   There's a footnote in New Work that covers this, very
            complicated.

    -   Two people are trans-world duplicates if they share all 
        relations, including extrinsic. However, any individual
        is a trans-world duplicate doesn't require extrinsic 
        properties.

-   If the world were gruesome, scientists would come up with predicates
    and terms, reference magnetism would make their laws false.
    -   *As a matter of fact*, the world is gruesome, but the predicates
        used aren't. If this was the kind of thing that happened, then
        scientists would formulate laws which would satisfy them, but
        from the POV of Lewis' God, it'd be unsatisfactory.
    -   The question is, about grue, is this epistemically accessible?
        -   If physicists could be fooled by this sort of gruesomeness,
            this would be bad for Lewis.

-   The thought that the theory of content will make it the case because
    of the use-features in an ideal theory look like it may not mitigate
    against ... because the theory is ideal.
    -   Predicates in such a theory have to pick out natural predicates.

### No Work for a Theory of Universals <small>by M. Eddon and C. J. G. Meacham</small>

#### Summary

#### What role does naturalnes play in Lewis' BSA?

BSA of Lawhood

:   Laws of nature are (only the regularities or anything) entailed
    by the best system, which is the set of true sentences that best
    balances simplicity and informativeness.

The Problem of the F

:   Among the candidate systems, there are systems that are maximally
    simple, manixmally informative, yet obviously not the best, such as
    the system axiomatized by only one universal generalization whose
    predicate applies to all and only the things in the actual world.

-   Two potential ways to solve The Problem of the F:
    1.  Constaint the language that is used to formualte the candidate
        system.
    2.  Constrain the metric that is used to evaluate the candidate 
        system.

#### How should we modify BSA if we give up naturalness?

-   If a reductionist gives up perfectly natural properties, what
    should she replace them wih in order to constrain the language?
    -   What should the reductionist say about the constraint on
        metrics.

Language-Objectivity

:   There is an objective, mind-indepedant language to formulate
    the candidate system in. Such a language contains predicates
    that only refer to perfectly natural properties.

Language-Indexicality

:   The candidate system is to be formulated in the language
    of the speaker. The speaker's assertion that *p* is a law
    is true just in case when the candidate systems are formulated
    in the speaker's lanaguage, the best system *entails* *p*.

Language-Rigidity

:   The candidate system is to be formulated in our actual language.

Language-Relativity

:   The candidate system can be formulated in any language. "Best-
    system-hood" is relative to a given language. Thus, lawhoood is
    also relative to the language.

Language-Salience

:   The candidate system is formulated in the langauge of the system
    (out of systems formualted in any language) best balances simplicity,
    informativeness, and saleince. Roughly speaking, salience includes criteria
    of unity, usefulness, and explanatory power.

And some options for the Metrics Question

Metrics-Objectivity

:   This is an objective, mind-indepedant way to measure the extent
    to which a system satisfies the criteria of simplicity, informativeness,
    balance, salience, etc.

Metrics-Indexicality

:   The candidate system is to be evaluated in the language of the speaker.
    The speaker's assertion that *p* is a law is true just in case when
    the candidate system are evaluated in the speaker's metrics, the
    best system entails *p*.

Metrics-Rigidity

:   The candidate system is to be evaluated in our actual metrics.

Metrics-Relativity

:   The candidate system can be evaluated in any metrics. "Best-system-hood"
    is relative to a given metrics. Thus, lawhood is also relative to the
    metrics.

#### Eddon and Meacham's Choice <small>Language-Salience and Metrics-Rigidity</small>

-   E+M argue that the best options are LS and MR. They think that these
    two are not problem-free, but they stand on firmer grounds than the
    other options. 
    -   Against the other options, they advance several objections.

##### Indexicality is too problematic

##### Relativity is too problematic
