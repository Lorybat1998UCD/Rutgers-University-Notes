### Meta

-   New Work of Universals
-   No Work on Universals
-   Humean Supervinience, Brian Weatherson
-   Philosophical Papers, David Lewis

### On Lewis

-   People say that he is the major metaphysician of the 20th century.
-   Pretty standard view of metaphysics, trying to figure out what
    exists in a general way.
-   What exists "is like."
-   What Aristotle was doing.
-   For Lewis, would could be and what is are very related.
-   He is most famous for his realism about possible worlds.
-   What makes something part of the same world?
    -   Spatio-temporal relations

-   How are worlds specified? If you're making worlds, what're you
    doing?
    -   You make a spatio-temporal manifold/structure.
    -   You need to fill it up with perfectly natural properties in
        spots.
    -   Natural properties and natural relations.
    -   You can think of it as being "decorated."

-   If you're going to specify spatio-temporal structure, what're you
    going to do?
    -   Points and metrics on the points.
    -   People have thought about physics without points.
    -   The more he says about possible worlds, the fewer possibilities
        there are.

-   Possible worlds have this structure of natural properties and
    particulars.
    -   He thought natural properties were the job of physics.
    -   What is it about the nature of physics that it's related to
        natural properties?

-   If you made a gigantic list of things that exist, some of those
    things would be possible worlds.
    -   What is it for one thing to be reduced to another?

-   Physics has the job of what is *actually instantiated*.
    -   Mosaic of natural properties is what things actually reduced to.
    -   Lewis' general metaphysics is a scientific metaphysics.

-   In the philosophy community, the realism about possible worlds was
    greeted with "incredulous stares."

-   We're interested in his views about "nomological varieties."
    -   We're interested in his account of laws, which is the Best
        Systems Account.
    -   Which hinges on his account of objective chance.

> Objective probability is one of the must *useful* tools in the natural
> sciences, but we have no idea what it is.

-   He uses this account to give an account of counterfactuals, and
    these play a gigantically big role in his account of everything
    else.
    -   Nelson Goodman, "Fact, Fiction, or Forecast"

-   In showing that something is sufficient in trying to indentify the
    laws is by looking at instances, at their role.
    -   This is a reductive enterprise.

### On Laws

-   What was background for Prof. Loewer and what's background for us,
    those he's teaching, is different.
    -   When he went to graduate school, the idea of thinking about the
        metaphysics of laws just wasn't there.
    -   There were pragmatic or semantic accounts of laws, but about
        asking the general way of what it means to be law.
    -   Philosophers were using "law" to explain what an event is.
        -   He made use of the idea of law with reference to Goodman on
            laws.

-   The way that Lewis got people to think about metaphysics just
        wasn't on the table.

-   In recent times, "What is a law?" was put right on the table by
    Dretske and Armstrong in the 70s and 80s.
    -   No one has written a history of the scientific account of laws.

-   Hume thought that laws were sentences that applied in a certain way
    (pragmatic).
-   Ayer had a non-factual view.
-   Hempel and "positive instances of a general law confirm it."
-   What are laws? They are of the form:

    $$(x)(Fx \to Gx)$$

    -   If you open a textbook in classical or quantum mechanics, you
        will no longer see sentences of this form.
    -   How damaging is this to their project?

-   Loewer's introduction to philosophy was when he was Amherst College
    and he wanted to date someone who thought a date was going to a talk
    by Max Black.
-   What is it to be "law-like" and what is the nature of law?
-   Hempel's paradox or the Raven paradox.
    -   How do we understand "confirms"?

-   If you have a paradox, you can say that a premise is bad, the
    reasoning form the premises is bad, or you accept the conclusion.

> If something is worth doing, it's worth doing wrong the first time.

<!-- -->

> There's less than meets the eye to Goodman's paradox.

-   Laws are very special projections.
-   Later, many philosophers adopted Goodman's language.
    -   A law is a generalation, but not any generalation.
    -   Only predicates that pick out *natural properties*.

-   There's a relationship of support between laws and counterfactuals.
    -   This is *at least* epistemological because if we know the law,
        we know the counterfactual. But the truth of the counterfactual
        doesn't mean the law is true.

-   How can a regularity explain anything?
    -   This is the really err intution.
    -   A regularity like all Fs are Gs.
    -   A law explains *why* something is true.
    -   Is the law doing the explaining?
    -   It's certainly an idea that people like Dretske and Hempel.

-   An explanation is a law along with an initial condition.
-   Armstrong thought that laws were some other part of reality, and
    they took from Goodman that the predicates must refer to certain
    kinds of properties.
    -   Gru does not pick out a universal.
    -   Does Armstrong think that Green is a universal?
    -   A universal is supposed to, those features that are the things
        that have them are exactly similar to one another.
    -   From the point of view of the science of color ...

-   For things to be an electron, it's a natural kind, universal.
-   An obvious consequence of the powers side is that if laws are things
    that cannot help but be instantiated.
    -   All the people Loewer knows think that when there are these
        powers there are these metaphysical connections, if they don't
        hold this they have to explain what these connections are.
    -   Metaphysically necessary connections.

-   Shoemaker thinks that there is only one possible world -- this one.
    -   All truths are necessary truths.

-   Take a look a Salmon about Humean and nonHumean.

### Next time

-   Step back to talk about Lewis
-   New Work on the Theory of Unverisals

January 30th, 2014 <small>Reading</small>
-----------------------------------------

### "New Work for a Theory of Universals" <small>by David Lewis</small>

#### Introduction

-   The "compulsory question" for systematic philosophy: the question of
    one over many.
    -   D.M. Armstrong thinks the answer is a theory of universals, but
        Lewis doesn't.
    -   But universal *can* do other things.

-   Although universals may be dispensible.
-   Lewis' ontology consists of *posibilia*.
    -   Along with the "iterative hierarchy of classes built upon them."
    -   Properties are not much like universals, and they cannot do the
        work of universals.

Posibilia
:   Particular, individual things, some of which comprise our actual
    world and other of which are unactualised.

-   Are universals better emplyed as a replacement for posibilia in
    Lewis' metaphysics?
    -   Not to be considered in this paper.

-   In the next section, Lewis will sketch Armstrong's theory of
    universals, constrasting them with properties understood as *classes
    of posibilia*.
    -   Then, he will say why the "One over Many" argument is
        unconvincing.

    -   Then, how universals help him in connection with the topics of:
        -   Duplication
        -   Supervenience
        -   Divergent worlds
        -   Minimal form for materialism
        -   Laws and causation
        -   Content of language and thought

    -   And perhaps the list could be extended

#### Universals and Properties

-   Language offers several more or less interchangable words, that is
    "universal" and "property" and "quality" and "attribute" ...
    -   Also "characteristic" and "kind" and "sort" and "type."

Universal
:   Those entities, if such there be, that mostly conform to Armstrong's
    account.

Property
:   Classes, any classes, but formemost classes of things.

:   To be a member of a class.

-   *Why call them **properties** as well as **classes**?*
    -   They do not need to be classes of *actual* things.
    -   The property of being a donkey is the class of *all* the
        donkeys.

Relation
:   Arbitrary classes of ordered pairs, triples, ... A relation among
    things is a property of tuples of things. With no restriction to
    actual things.

-   Universals and properties are different in two ways.
    1.  Their instantiation
        -   It is a contituent part of each particular that has it.
        -   A property is "spread around."

        > The property of being a donkey is partyly present wherever
        > there is a donkey, in this or any other world. Far from the
        > property being part of the donkey, it is closer to the truth
        > to say that the donkey is part of the property. But the
        > precise truth, rather, is that the donkey is a member of the
        > property.

        -   Thus universals would unify reality in a way that properties
            do not.
        -   Things that share a universal have not just joined a single
            class. They literally have something in common. They are not
            entirely distinct. They overlap.
        -   Universals defy intuitive principles. \*The intuitions were
            made for particulars\*.
        -   *Is copresense transitive?* **No**.

        > Round, silver, golden. Silver and round are copresent, for
        > here is a silver coin. Golden and round are copresent, for
        > there is a round coin; but silver and golden are no copresent.

    2.  Their abundance. This is the difference that qualifies for
        different work.

        -   Universal are sparse in Armstrong's work. \*There are the
            universals that that there must be to ground the
            resemblences and causal powers of things, and there is no
            reason to believe in any more.\* These would be rejected:
            1.  Not golden
            2.  Golden or wooden
            3.  Metallic
            4.  Self-identical
            5.  Owned by Fred
            6.  Belonging to class *C*
            7.  Grue
            8.  First examined before 2000 A.D.
            9.  Being identical
            10. Being alike in some respect
            11. Being exactly alike
            12. Being part of
            13. Owning
            14. Being paired with by some part in *R*

        -   The world's universals should comprise of a minimal basis
            for characterizing the world completely.
        -   Universals that do not contribute to this or are redundant
            are unwelcome.
        -   *A non-linguistic counterpart of a primitavely vocabulary
            for a language capable of describing the world
            exhaustively.*

Copresent
:   Two entities are *copresent* if both are wholly present at one
    position in space and time.

-   It is quite different for *properties*.
    -   Any class of things, regardless of characteristic of the class,
        is a property.
        -   So they are of immense abundance.

    -   **There are so many properties that those specifiable in
        English, or in the brain's language of synaptic interconnections
        and neural spikes, could be only an infitesimal minority.**

-   There so many properties that any two things share an infinite
    amount of properties and fail to share inifitely many as well.
    -   This is so whether the two things are duplicates or utterly
        dissimilar.
        -   Properties do not capture resemblence.

    -   Properties are causally irrelevant.
    -   Properties "carve reality at the joints."

Natural properties
:   Properties whose sharing makes for resemblance, and the ones
    relevant to causal powers.

Perfectly natural properties
:   If the members of the class are all and only those things that share
    some one universal.

-   An *adequate* theory of propeties is one that recognizes an
    objective difference between natural and unnatural properties.
-   A Nominalistic theory of properties could achieve adequacy by
    drawing primitive distinctions between particulars.
-   A Nominalist in pursuit of adequacy might prefer to rest with
    primitive objective resemblance among things.

Nominalism
:   the doctrine that universals or general ideas are mere names without
    any corresponding reality, and that only particular objects exist;
    properties, numbers, and sets are thought of as merely features of
    the way of considering the things that exist.

-   At this point, it could be a good idea to believe in universals \*as
    well as\* properties.
    -   "Properties have work of their own, and universals are
        ill-suited to do the work of properties."

-   Consider these sentences:
    1.  Red resembles organge more than it resembles blue.
    2.  Red is a color.
    3.  Humility is a virtue.
    4.  Redness is a sign of ripeness.

    *Prima facie*, these sentences contain names to denote individual
    things.

-   It is unlikely that there are universals for colors, especially
    particular colors.
    -   Unless you subject the phrases to paraphrasing.

-   Let *x* range over things, *P* over properties (classes) of things.
    Then:

    $$\exists_1 P \Box \forall x (x \in P \equiv 0x)$$

#### One Over Many

-   Armstrong's main argument is the "One over Many" argument.
    -   It is *because* that Lewis finds this unsatisfactory that he is
        seeking alternatives.

-   An effort at systemic philosophy must give an account of purpoted
    fact.
    -   There are three ways:
        1.  I deny it.
        2.  I analyse it thus ... .
        3.  I accept it as primitive.

Moorean fact
:   one of those things that we know better than we know the premises of
    any philosophical argument to the contrary

-   An adequate Nominalism is a theory that takes Moorean facts of
    apparent sameness of a type as primitive.
    -   Universals are one possible solution, but not the only, and not
        even the best (?).

-   Early in *Universals* it "undergoes an unfortunate double
    transformation."
    -   The *analysandum* becomes the schema:

        > *a* has the property *F*.

    -   The turning point takes only two sentences:

        > How is [the Nominalist] to account for the apparent (if
        > usually partial) identity of numerically different
        > particulars? How can two different things both be white or
        > both be on a table?

        -   "There are no universals but the proposition *a* is *F* is
            perfectly alright as it is." (Dodging the question.)

-   **Class Nominalism** fails because it employs predications of class
    membership, which predications it cannot without circularity analyze
    in terms of class membership.
-   **Resemblance Nominalism** fails to analyze predications of
    resemblance.
-   Predications of particpation evade analysis.

#### Duplication, Supervinience, and Divergent Worlds

-   From now on, they'll only be natural, unnatural, or more-or-less
    natural properties.
-   Beginning the analysis with *duplication*.

##### Duplication

Duplication
:   Ex, uing a copying machine. A perfect copier would make the two
    items the same in terms of atomic structure, making the two items,
    the copy and the original, indiscernible.

:   Two things are duplicates if and only if they have precisely the
    same intrinsic properties, however much their extrinisic properties
    might differ.

Intrinsic property
:   Property *P* is instrinsic if and only if, for any two duplicate
    things, not necessarily from the same world, either both have *P* or
    neither does.

Extrinsic property
:   Property *P* is extrinsic if and only in there is some such pair of
    duplicates of which one has *P* and the other lacks *P*.

-   If we relied on physical theory to be accurate and exhaustive, we
    might define duplication in physical terms.
    -   But this definition is no analysis because it presupposes the
        contigent physics of this actual world.

-   Duplication is better analyzed in terms of *shared properties*.
    -   To begin with *natural properties* and then move to *intrinsic
        properties*.

-   If Materialism were false and physics an utter failures, as it is in
    some deplorable worlds, there would still be duplication in terms of
    *shared natural properties*.

-   All *perfectly natural properties* are *intrinsic properties*.
    -   However, intrinsic properties can be disjunctive and
        miscellaneous and unnatural, so long as they never differ
        between duplicates.

-   Duplication is important for two topics in metaphysics:
    supervenience and divergent worlds.

##### Supervenience

-   A supervenience thesis is a denial of indepedant variation.
    -   It can be defined with *posibilia*.
    -   To say that so-and-so supervenes on such-and-such is to stay
        there can be no idefference in respect to so-and-so without
        difference in respect to such-and-such.

        > Beauty of statues supervenes on their shape, size, and colour,
        > for instance, if no two statures, in the same or different
        > worlds, ever differ in beauty without also differing in shape
        > or size or colour.

-   A supervenience thesis is cautiously reductionist.
-   The worst that can happen is that an ascription of a supervenient
    property is equivilent to an uncountably infinite disjunction of
    maximally specfic descriptions of the other property.

Local duplicates
:   Two worlds are *local duplicates* just in case they are divisible
    into corresponding small parts in such that that: 1. Corresponding
    parts of the two worlds are duplicates, and 2. The correspondence
    preserves spatiotemporal relations.

##### Divergent worlds

Diverge
:   Two possible worlds *diverage* just in case they are not duplicates
    but they do duplicate initial temporal segmant. For example, our
    world and another might match perfectly up through the year 1945,
    and go their separate ways thereafter.

Branching
:   Instead of duplicate segments, one and the same initial segment is
    allegedly share as a common part of two overlapping worlds.

Determinism
:   A system of laws of nature is Determinsitic just in case no two
    divergent worlds both conform perfectly to the laws of that system.

:   A world is Deterministic just in case its laws comprise a
    Determinsitic system.

:   Determinism is the thesis that our world is Deterministic.

#### Minimal Materialism

-   There is a difficulty in definining reductionist views as
    supervenience theses.
    -   The solution is to employ *natural properties* not only by way
        of *duplication* but in a *more direct way* also.

Materialism
:   The these that physics is a comprehensive theory of the world,
    complete as well as correct.

:   The world is as physics says it is, and there's no more to say.

:   Materialism is not a thesis of finite translatability of all our
    language into the language of physics.

:   Materialism is not to be indentified with any one Materialist theory
    of mind. It is a thesis that motivates a varity of theories of mind:

    -   Behaviorism
    -   Functionalism
    -   The mind-body identity theory
    -   Mind is a mistake

:   Materialism is not just the theory that there are no things except
    those things indentified by physics. Materialism *don't* believe in
    spirit, or other such nonphysical things.

:   Materialism is at least in part the thesis that there are no natural
    properties instantiated at our world except those recognized by
    physics. Couldn't ther be a natural property *X* which is shared by
    the physical brains in worlds like ours and the immaterial spirits
    that inhabit other worlds? Or by thisworldy quarks and otherwordly
    particles that cannot exist under our physics?

:   > **(M1)**: Any two possible worlds that are exactly alike in all
    > respects recognized by physics are qualitative duplicates.

    -   This will not do. A world could differ in having Materialism
        false, as it is contigent and non-physical, and then you could
        have epiphenomenal spirits and not differ physically by not be a
        qualititative duplicate.

:   > **(M2)**: There is no differe, *a fortiori* no mental difference,
    > without some nonmental difference. Any two worlds alike in all
    > nonmental respect are duplicate, and in particular do not differ
    > in respect of the mental lives of their inhabitants.

    -   This fails, I think, because worlds can differ in the mental
        lives of the inhabitants but be physically identical (?).

:   > **(M3)**: No two Materialistic worlds differ without differing
    > physically; any two Materialistic worlds that are exactly alike
    > physically are duplicates.

    -   Any world, however spirit=ridden, belongs to such a class.

:   > **(M4)**: Among worlds that conform to the actual laws of nature, no
    > two differ without differing physically; any two worlds that are
    > exactly alike physically are duplicates.

    -   Less that Materialism because M4 could hold a world where
        Materialism is false but where spiritual phenomena are
        correlated with physical phenomena accords to strict laws.

    -   More than Materialism because M\$ fails to hold at a
        Materialistic, spirit-free world if the laws of the world do not
        preculd the existence of epiphenomenal spirts. "Absent, but not
        outlawed."

:   > **(M5)**: Among worlds where no natural properties are alien to our
    > world are instantiated, no two differ without differing
    > physically; any two such worlds that are exactly alike physically
    > are duplicated.

Alien property
:   A property is *alien* to a world just in case:

    1.  It is not instantiated by any inhabitant of that world;
    2.  It is not analysable as a conjunction of, or as a structural
        property constractu out of, natural properties all of which are
        instantiated by inhabitants of that world.

#### Laws and Causation

##### Laws

-   **What is it to be a law of nature?**
    -   You need universals, or at least natural properties, to explain
        lawhood.

-   Armstrong's theory holds that what makes regularities lawful are
    second-order state of affais *N(F,G)* in which the two ordinary,
    first-order universals *F* and *G* are related by a certain dyadic
    second-order universal *N*.
    -   The "lawmaker" *N*.

    > But I say that N deserves the name of 'necessitation' only if,
    > somehow, it really can enter into the requisite necessary
    > connections. It can't enter into them just by bearing a name, any
    > more than one can have mighty biceps just by being called
    > 'Armstrong'.

-   Necessary connection can be unintelligible even when they are
    supposed to obtain between existences that are not clearly and
    wholly distinct.
-   Some regularity is accidental, but laws are regularities.
    -   So we must be selective.
    -   Reject "lawlikeness" plus truth.
    -   A suitabl system has:
        -   The virtues we aspire to in "our own theory-building."
        -   Has them to the greatest extent possible.
        -   Must be entirely true.
        -   It must be closed under strict implication.
        -   It must be as simple in axiomatisation as it can be without
            sacrificing to much information content.
        -   It must have as much information content as it can without
            sacrificing too much simplicity.

    -   The ideal system need not consist entirely of regularities,
        particular facts may gain entry if they contribute enough to
        collective simplicity and strength.

##### Causation

-   Causation involves laws
-   We need the kind of counterfactuals that avoid backtracking
-   Causation holds between events.
    -   If you put butter on the skillet, it melts, what causes this?
        -   There is one event that we can call a moving of molecules.

-   Heat is that phemonemon.
    -   It occurs in virtue of two facts:
        1.  That the skillet's molecules are moving rapidly.
        2.  That the region in question is part of a world where
            molecular motion is what occupies the heat-role.

### Introduction

-   Next week, Armstrong

> 1.  What is a law?
> 2.  What are fundamental properties?

-   Both of these question involve "what is at issue" and "is
    there a fact of the matter?" and "what's the methodology?"

### Presentation on "New Work for a Theory of Universals"

#### Set Up

Armstrong

:   Accept an entity "wholly present whereever it is instantiated"
    that's a "constituent part ... of each particular that has it."
    Accept universals! Universals make for *objective similarity* 
    and *unify reality* - Similar things *literally* overlap.

Lewis

:   Has *possibilia* and *classes of possibilia*

-   **Aim to show**: Lewis needs to add something to his basic ontology
    to do some work. 
    -   **Strategy**:
        1.  Explain the difference between universals and properties
        2.  Show how universals can do important work that properties cannot.
        3.  Once this job is done, you can do a lot of other work.

-   **The work**:
    1.  Similarity
    2.  Duplication
    3.  Supervinience
    4.  Determinism
    5.  Materialism
    6.  Determinacy of content
    7.  Laws
    8.  Causation

-   **Sidequest 1**: Show that Amrstron's argument for universals (one over many)
    isn't good.
-   **Sidequest 2**: Show that we still need properties. Universal cannot do all the
    work.

#### Universals and Properties

1.  Universals are *located* wholly where their instances are, are part of their
    instances. 
    -   Properties are spread out, their instance are "part of" them.

2.  Universals are *sparse*. There are only enough to account for the similarity
    facts. 
    -   Properties are abundant, there are tons of them.

#### Basic Job - Similarity

-   **Upshot of fact 2**: Universal can account for similarity. Properties *cannot*.
-   Make some properties shin. They are the natural properties and account make
    for similarity.

Primitive naturalness

:   Some properties are natural, some aren't.

Primitive resemblance

:   The members of this plurality resemble each other more than they
    do the members of any other plurality. Resemblance is primitive.

#### Duplication

Problem

:   Duplicate are analyzed in terms of sharing *intrinsic properties*.
    Intrinsic properties are analyzed as those shared by duplicates.

Solution

:   Duplicates are those things that share perfectly natural properties.

:   Duplications are those things whose parts bear isomorphisms
    and share natural properties and relations.

#### Supervenience

-   The *A*s supervene on the *B*s when similarity among *B*s means
    similarity among *A*s.
    -   Using our fancy new duplication stuff: If duplicating the *B*s
        means match among *A*s.

#### Determinism

Problem

:   "Every event has a cause" ignore probabilistic cause. "Ideal predictor"
    ignores "obstacle to calculation."

Solution

:   Divergent worlds are not duplicates, but have duplicate initial segments.
    Deterministic laws don't allow for digergent worlds. Determinstics worlds
    are worlds with determinstic laws.

#### Materialism

Problem

:   Want materialism to be:

    -   Contigent
    -   Involve physics
    -   Allow for panpsychism
    -   Account for the "something extraness" of spooks
    -   Account for the "sufficiency of the physical"

Solution

:   Alien properties aren't instantiated at our world, nor constructible from
    out natural properties. Materialism says that in worlds without alien
    properties, worlds alike physically are duplicates.

#### Content

Putnam

:   If content is fixed by what satisifes (idealidized) theory, it's indeterminate.

Kripkenstein

:   No proper subsequence of use determines next element.

Solution

:   We need more constraints. If constraints are causal, natural properties "get in."

Lewis

:   Some properties are inherently eligible to be referents to our words.
    Objects become eligible by instantiating eligible properties.

    Eligibility is proportional to naturalness. Content is determined by 
    maximizing fit with use and eligibility.

#### Laws

Problem

:   Why are some regularities laws and others not?

Armstrong

:   A regularity "All Fs are Gs" is a law iff necessitation holds between
    F and G

Lewis

:   This is unintelligible

    > We must treat regularities not one at a time, but rather as candidates
    > to enter into integrated sysmtes. For a given regularity might hold either
    > as a law or accidentally, depending on whether other regulairties obtain
    > that can fit together with it in a suitable system.

    -   A suitable system has virtues we can aspire to:
        1.  Truth
        2.  Closed under strict implication
        3.  Simple
        4.  Informative

    -   Need a restriction on language we can use. 
        -   Acount is trivialized otherwise.
        -   What is the primitive language of the laws? *The perfectly
            natural properties, of course!*

    -   The best system yses perfectly natural predicates for its primitive
        vocabulary, has properties (1) and (2), and has the best tradeoff
        between (3) and (4).

#### BSA

BSA

:   A law is a regularity of the best system. A fundamental law is an axiom.

#### Causation

Lewis

:   *C* is a cause of *E* iff the closesnt non-bracktacking worlds in which
    *C* does not occur that evolve in accordance with the laws are were *E*
    does not occur.

    Natural properties show up in laws, so they show up in causes too
    Non-backtracking is understood in terms of divergent worlds.
    Another place for natural properties.

    Only *genuine events* can cause. Natural properties pick out genuine
    events.

#### Natural Properties and Physics

-   Physics "aspires to give an inventory of natural properties." 
    Why think this?
    -   There are **three arguments**:
        1.  M5/Materialism

            :   "In putting forward comprehensive theories, physics
                proposes investorys of the natural properties instanstiated
                in our world." Lewis claims that comprehensiveness of
                physics should be understood in terms of M5. The link
                between natural properties and duplication is supposed to
                support a link between natural properties and physics.

        2.  Laws causes

            :   Physicists search for laws of nature and causes. If laws
                must be sated in the language of natural properties, then
                physicists search for natural properties and
                succeed when they find laws.

        3.  Similarities and Differences

            :   Physicists seek to tell us about the real similarities and
                difference between things. "Cutting nature at its joints."
                This is the first *job* of natural properties.

#### Natural Properties and Induction

-   Lewis doesn't say a whole lot to link natural properties and induction.
    It seems he is poised to answer Goodman's riddle. He got a way of 
    separating green and guem and that's the important thing. But we
    still need a way to explain why natural properties are projectable.
-   The closest thing we find to a treatment is in the "Content" bit.
    -   **Paraphrase**: "We need principles of charity. Such principles
        call for interpretations accord to which the subject has
        attitudes we deem reasonable. They impose presumptions about
        what inductive biases someone may be righly interpreted to have.
        We need natural propertoes. Principles of charity impute a bias
        towards believing green rather than grue."
    -   Two ways to take this:
        1.  Induction first: Natural properties detemine which properties
            it is reasonable to project directly. Content is fixed by that
            somehow. (Weatherson)
        2.  Content first: Natural properties determine which contents are
            eligibile. Rationality of induction is fixed by that somehow.

    -   **Perhaps most reasonable**: natural properties play a certain
        role in lawlikeness and counterfactuals. This allows them to 
        figure into two roles Goodman identified for projectable
        predicates.

#### Physical Magnitudes and Determinates

-   We should expect some physical mangitudes (mass, charge) to be
    perfectly natural. We should be surprised is some determinaites
    are perfectly natural.
-   But magnitudes and determinates exclude each other.
    -   Nothing is 5 *and* 7kg. Nothing is red *and* blue.
        How is this possible? Necessary connections among
        distinct existents?

-   Two proposals:
    1.  Add some necessary connections!
    2.  Exclusion is nomically necessary, based on nomic necessity
        of magnitudes and dense linear orders. 
        -   Exclusion of dense linear orders is logically and
            metaphysically necessary.

### What is Humean Supervenience?

-   Human Supervenience
    1.  **Truth supervenes on being**
        -   All the facts about the world supervene on facts about
            which individuals instantiate which fundamental properties
            and relations.
        -   This is the core part of Lew's metaphysics.
        -   Lewis thinks the fundamental properties and relations
            of the world characterize the world *without redunancy*
        -   If *earlier than* and *later than* are fundamental, then
            there is some redunadancy in the characterization of the
            world in terms of fundamental properties.
            -   But it's hard to see how one is fundamental and the other
                isn't.

        -   We'll stick to fundamental properties characterizing the
            world *completely*.

    2.  **Anti-haeccaetism**
        -   All the facts about a world supervene on the distribution of
            qualitative properties and relation.
        -   Rearranging which properties hang on which 'hooks' doesn't
            change any facts.
        -   Consider what it would be like for anti-haeccaetism to fail.
            There would have to be two worlds, with the same distribution
            of qualitative properties, but with different facts obtaining
            in each.

    3.  **Spatio-temporalism**
        -   The only fundamental relations that are actually instantiated
            are spatio-temporal, and all fundamental properties are
            properties of points or point-sized occupants of points.

#### Supervenience

Strong Modal HS

:   For any two worlds where the spatio-temporal distribution of fundamental
    qualities is the same, the contigent facts are the same.

-   It is consistent with HS that there could be *fundamental non-spatio
    temporal relations*.
    -   HS claims that there are no such relations *instantiated*.

Local Modal HS

:   For any two worlds at which no alien properties or relations are 
    instantiated, if the spatio-temporal distribution of fundamental
    qualities is the same at each world, the contigent facts are also
    the same.

-   "Enduring objects" would generate counterexamples.

Familiar Modal HS

:   For any two "worlds like ours" if the spatio-temporal distribution of
    fundamental qualities is the same at each world, the contigent facts
    are also the same.

#### What is Perfect Naturalness?

-   We do need to understand what it is to be *fundamental* and *perfectly
    natural*.

> ...two things are duplicates if and only if
> 
>   1.  they have exactly the same *perfectly natural properties*, and 
>   2.  their parts can be put into correspondence in such a way 
>       that corresponding parts have exactly the same *perfectly 
>       natural properties*, and stand in the same *perfectly 
>       natural relations*.
>
> **(Lewis, 1986a, 61)**

Perfectly natural properties

:   -   There is a small class of properties and relations such that the
        facts at any world supervene on the distribution of these properties
        and relations.
    -   Each of these properties is an intrinsic property.
    -   At the actual world, the only relations among these which are
        instantiated are spatio-temporal, and all the contigent facts 
        supervene not merely on the distribution of fundamental qualities
        and relations, but also on the distribution of fundamental qualties
        and relations *over points and point-sized occupants of points*.

#### Humean Supervenience and the other Humean Thesis

-   There are three views that Lewis endorses that can broadly
    be described as "human":
    
    HS

    :   See above.

    Nomological Reductionism

    :   Nomological properties and relations (including lawhood, chance,
        and causation) are not among the fundamental properties and
        relations.

    Modal Combinatorialism

    :   Roughly, anything can co-exist with anything else.

### Introduction

#### The importantance of our topic

-   The question, "What is a law of nature" is central to philosophy
    of science.
    -   But also to epistemology and metaphysics.
    -   In this section, Amstrong will establish why it's important
        both narrowly and broadly.

-   Natural science has three tasks.
    1.  Geography and history of the universe.
        -   Taking "geography" to cover space and "history" to cover
            time.
    
    2.  Discover what sorts of thing and what sorts of property there
        are in the universe and how they are constituted.
    3.  State the laws which the things in space and time obey.

-   It may not be obvious that there is a second task to be distinguished
    from the third.
    -   Heat *is* molecular motion is not a historical or geographical
        truth.
        -   This is not a law of nature or a "bridge law"
        -   It is something different, a constituate of a property or range
            of properties in terms of more ultimate properties.

-   These three inquiries are inextricably linked.
    -   They can only be pursued in conjunction.

-   If discovery of law is of the traditional tasks of natural science,
    then the nature of a law of nature must be a central ontological
    concern for philosophy of science.
-   The question of "What is a law of nature?" has a wider and philosophical
	importance.
	-   The *only* relation that allows us to move from observed matters of
		fact to *unobserved* matters of fact is cause and effect.
		-   Without this, we cannot move beyond observation.

-   If you appeal to Hume, you can say that inferences to particular
	unobserved phenomena would be unreliable without laws of nature.
-   But you don't have to.
    -   The proposition is obvious enough in itself.
    -   The scientist trying to establish the geography and history of the
        ubobserved universe must depends on laws.
    -   When we make day-to-day inferences, it's not as important.
        -   It's still irrational to make inferences without laws.

-   Hume: "Inference from the observed to the unobserved is central to
    our whole life as humans."
    -   Without such laws, inferences would not be reliable.
    -   Hence, important question for *epistemology*.
    -   If so, we want to know about its *ontology*.
        -   We will want to know what a law *is*.

-   The view that would evade this arguments would the view that, "althought
    there are regularities in the world, there are no laws of nature."
    -   It "denies that the world contains anything except these regularities."

-   Problem with this view: What reason we can to think the world is regular.
    -   Problem of induction, too.

#### A possible difficulty in investigating our topic

> **Paradox of Analysis**: If we ask what sore of thing an X is then either
> we know what an X is or we do not. If we know, then there is no need to
> ask the question. If we do not, we have no way to begin the investigation.

-   The solution? We have a fuzzy notion and we're reflecting on it.
-   If we can securely get instances of X, you can "tie the inquiry down."
    -   If we can be sure that an *a* is an X, then we can use other things which
        we know or believe about *a* to check the proposed account of X.

-   **The Problem**: There are no secure paradigms of laws of nature.
    -   Consider contemporary natural science. It is perfectly epistemically
        possible that we dont know a single law of nature.
        -   This may be the handicap to answering the question, of what is a
            law of nature.

-   Even though we can point to no secure paradigm of laws, the scientific
    theories we now work with contain what at least some real laws of nature.
    -   If our theories do no nearly grasp the truth, we would be unable
        to explain why so many predictions are succesful.
    -   We do theoritical calculations allow us to get safely to and from the
        moon?
        -   Can hardly be mere fantasy.

    -   We can make an inference to the best explanation from the predicition
        success of contemporary science to the such theories have tolerable
        accuracy.

-   Even some pre-science laws are pretty good.
    -   Consider these examples:
        -   Fire burns
        -   Bread nourishes
        -   Water suffocates

    -   If these were not true, then we would all be dead.

-   This indicates the importance of fighting skepticism about this topic.
    -   He considers this a **reply**.

-   The secone **response** to the objection is that we know the *forms* that
    the laws take.
    -   Consider these forms that use dummies:
        1.  It is a law that Fs are Gs.
        2.  It is a law that an F has a certain probability of being a G.
        3.  It is a law that the quantities of P and Q co-vary in such a
            way that Q is  certain functino of P (Q = f(P)).

    -   We can largely proceed with these schemata.
        -   Philosophers cannot make any serious contribution to the *scientific*
            project of actually determining the laws.
        -   To every subject, its appropriate level of abstraction.

-   If concrete examples are required, there are examples in current and earlier
    science.
    -   Newton's Law is not *strictly* a law, but an approximation of a wide range
        of phenomena.
    -   It makes for a good stand-in for a law of nature.

#### Assumptions

-   **Assumption**: The truth of a Realisitic account of laws of nature.
    -   That they exist indepedantly of the minds which attempt to grasp them.

Law-statements

:   May be true or fase. If they are true, what *makes them true* is a law.

-   Behind all anti-Realist views of laws stands the RT.
    -   Regularities are the Realistic component of anti-Realist theories of laws.
        -   As a result, a destructive critique of Regularity theory will undermine
            anti-Realist theories of laws.

-   **Assumption**: On Realism about universals.
    -   Not even the Regularity theory can be developed without universals.
    -   The Realist about laws who wishes to go beyond Regularity must use 
        universals.

-   **Assumption**: Actualism

Actualism

:   We should not postualte any particulars except actual particulars, not any
    properties and relations save actual, or categorical, properties and relations.

    This debars us not from the past and future, but from using the merely possible,
    both logical and physical.

#### The Regularity Theory

-   There are many who would *like* regularity theory to be true.
    -   This influence makes it powerful.

-   In the course of the criticism, we'll see  what a good theory of laws *ought*
    to do.
-   After disposing of Regularity theory, it will be shown that any satisfactory
    account of laws must involve universals, and irreducible relations between them.


### Critique of the Regularity theory (1) <small>The problem of accidental uniformities</small>

-   Laws of nature characteristically *manifest* themselves or *issue* 
    regularity
-   Philosophers usually think of a Regularituy theory of *causation*,
    but what is considered here is a Regularity theory of *laws*.

RT of Causation

:   1.  That causal connection is a species of law-like connection.
    2.  That laws are nothing but regularities in the behavior of things.

#### The naive regularity theory of law

-   George Molnar's criticism of Regularity theory of laws
    -   Outline of a theory called RT of laws of nature, called *Naive
        Regularity* theory.
    -   He then considers an argument against such a theory, an argument
        from unrealized physical possibilities.
    -   He then argues that none of the judicious modifications in spirit
        of the theory are satisfactory.

-   But the tactic can be generalized to RT in general, not just laws.

> *p* is a **statement** of a law of nature just in case:
>
> 1.  *p* is universally quantified
> 2.  *p* is [omnitemporally and omnispatially] true
> 3.  *p* is contigent
> 4.  *p* contains only non-local empirical predicates, apart from
>     logical connectives and quantifiers.

#### Classification of ciriticisms of the RT

-   If we take "Humean uniformities" and try to identify them with "the
    laws of nature", difficulties of identification arise.
    -   There are Humean uniformities that are not laws.
        -   Being a Humean uniformity is not *sufficient* to be a law of
            nature.
        -   There are laws that do not apply at all times, there are laws
            which are probabilistic.
        -   So it's also not necessary that a law of nature be a Humean
            uniformity.

-   Even if these difficulties can be overcome, there are others.
    -   It is a law that all Fs are Gs just in case all Fs are Gs where
        the latter is a Humean regularity

-   The "intensional" difficulties are in Chapter 4.
-   Chapter 5 will Chisolm until it is clear it's not worth it.

#### Single-case uniformities

-   The laws of nature are, at best, a sub-class of the class of HUs.
    -   A recognized research programme is finding a wa to cut out the unwanted
        HUs will remaining faithful to RT.
    -   This first case is *against* Naive RT, which identifies laws and HU.

-   Probably, every object in the univers differs in its properties from
    every other object.
    -   By this, general, non-local properties.
        -   "Living in Australia" is not a property.
        -   "Being a light-second distant from proton A" is not a general
            relation property.
        -   "Being a light-second distant from a proton" would be satisfactory.
 
-   For each particular, therefore, it is likely that there exists at
    least one *individual conjunction* of properties, that is, a conjunction
    of properties.

#### How to pass from single-case uniformitie ot multi-case uniformities

-   Given a plurality of single-case HU, we can immediately construct plural-case
    HU which have no reason to believe are manifestations of laws of nature.
    -   Consider individuating conjuctions of properties A, B, and C associated
        with particulars *a*, *b*, and *c*.
        -   We can say that whenever an object is of the sort then it further has
            the property.

-   The problem of to exclude a disjunctive set of affairs is a close cousing to
    the problem introduced by Nelson Goodman with the predicates "grue" and "bleen."
    -   Suppose all things green turn blue after 2000, and all blue things green.
    -   Rlative to the predicates "green" and "blue" all things change.
    -   The problem is to say why one set of predicates should have preference over
        the other.

-   A Regularity account of laws to be developed in a Realistic way must be stipulated
    that only certain non-local predicates can be used to state "uniformities."
    -   Admissible predicates must carve reality along some join, natural,
        unified, objectively resembling class of phenomena.
        -   Otherwise these "uniformities" are not *uniformities*.

### Review of Lewis' Fundamental Ontology

-   What makes a possible world concrete?
-   What makes a possible world?
    -   Unclear: Sometimes he writes as though there spacetime points,
        sometimes he writes as though there are others.
    -   If he wrote a list:
        -   Spacetime structure
        -   Spacetime points
        -   Fields, particles

    -   His ontology becomes very *sparse*.
        -   *I guess* he's commit to a substanvilism (...)

-   Natural properties, one way of understanding them is special sets.
    -   Special in a couple ways:
        1.  Exemplifictions in all possible worlds (...)
        2.  Supervinience

-   Everything is *made true* by something in his ontology.
-   He didn't want to rule out alien, that is unconcievable, properties,
    structures, and individuals.
-   It's easy to think that the natural properties have intrinsic natures.
    -   He's open to the idea.

-   Strawson has this idea that we're *acquinted* with intrinsic natures.
    -   What's the *intrisic nature* of being a quark?
        -   For him, that is Strawson, it's an experiential argument.

Property

:   Set of *possibilia*

Possibilia

:   Possible worlds.

-   Natural relations supervene on natural properties
    -   What does Lewis say about this and extrinsic/intrinsic?
        -   There's a footnote in New Work that covers this, very
            complicated.

    -   Two people are trans-world duplicates if they share all 
        relations, including extrinsic. However, any individual
        is a trans-world duplicate doesn't require extrinsic 
        properties.

-   If the world were gruesome, scientists would come up with predicates
    and terms, reference magnetism would make their laws false.
    -   *As a matter of fact*, the world is gruesome, but the predicates
        used aren't. If this was the kind of thing that happened, then
        scientists would formulate laws which would satisfy them, but
        from the POV of Lewis' God, it'd be unsatisfactory.
    -   The question is, about grue, is this epistemically accessible?
        -   If physicists could be fooled by this sort of gruesomeness,
            this would be bad for Lewis.

-   The thought that the theory of content will make it the case because
    of the use-features in an ideal theory look like it may not mitigate
    against ... because the theory is ideal.
    -   Predicates in such a theory have to pick out natural predicates.

### No Work for a Theory of Universals <small>by M. Eddon and C. J. G. Meacham</small>

#### Summary

#### What role does naturalnes play in Lewis' BSA?

BSA of Lawhood

:   Laws of nature are (only the regularities or anything) entailed
    by the best system, which is the set of true sentences that best
    balances simplicity and informativeness.

The Problem of the F

:   Among the candidate systems, there are systems that are maximally
    simple, manixmally informative, yet obviously not the best, such as
    the system axiomatized by only one universal generalization whose
    predicate applies to all and only the things in the actual world.

-   Two potential ways to solve The Problem of the F:
    1.  Constaint the language that is used to formualte the candidate
        system.
    2.  Constrain the metric that is used to evaluate the candidate 
        system.

#### How should we modify BSA if we give up naturalness?

-   If a reductionist gives up perfectly natural properties, what
    should she replace them wih in order to constrain the language?
    -   What should the reductionist say about the constraint on
        metrics.

Language-Objectivity

:   There is an objective, mind-indepedant language to formulate
    the candidate system in. Such a language contains predicates
    that only refer to perfectly natural properties.

Language-Indexicality

:   The candidate system is to be formulated in the language
    of the speaker. The speaker's assertion that *p* is a law
    is true just in case when the candidate systems are formulated
    in the speaker's lanaguage, the best system *entails* *p*.

Language-Rigidity

:   The candidate system is to be formulated in our actual language.

Language-Relativity

:   The candidate system can be formulated in any language. "Best-
    system-hood" is relative to a given language. Thus, lawhoood is
    also relative to the language.

Language-Salience

:   The candidate system is formulated in the langauge of the system
    (out of systems formualted in any language) best balances simplicity,
    informativeness, and saleince. Roughly speaking, salience includes criteria
    of unity, usefulness, and explanatory power.

And some options for the Metrics Question

Metrics-Objectivity

:   This is an objective, mind-indepedant way to measure the extent
    to which a system satisfies the criteria of simplicity, informativeness,
    balance, salience, etc.

Metrics-Indexicality

:   The candidate system is to be evaluated in the language of the speaker.
    The speaker's assertion that *p* is a law is true just in case when
    the candidate system are evaluated in the speaker's metrics, the
    best system entails *p*.

Metrics-Rigidity

:   The candidate system is to be evaluated in our actual metrics.

Metrics-Relativity

:   The candidate system can be evaluated in any metrics. "Best-system-hood"
    is relative to a given metrics. Thus, lawhood is also relative to the
    metrics.

#### Eddon and Meacham's Choice <small>Language-Salience and Metrics-Rigidity</small>

-   E+M argue that the best options are LS and MR. They think that these
    two are not problem-free, but they stand on firmer grounds than the
    other options. 
    -   Against the other options, they advance several objections.

##### Indexicality is too problematic

-   Imagine Aristotle, whose metrics are different from Newton's,
    saying the following:
    
    > (2) If I had Newton's metrics, then the laws would be Newtonian
    > mechanics.
    >
    > (4) If I had Newton's metrics and I were to say, "The laws are
    > Newtonian mechanics", then my assertion would be true.

    That is, (2) and (4) are *intuitively false*, but Metrics-Indexicality 
    predicts that they are true. **Note**: The intended intuitive 
    readings become obvious when you hold fixed the laws.

##### Relativity is too problematic

-   Our concept of lawhood is "deeply related" to modal, causal, and
    other philosophical concepts. If lawhood becomes relativized to languages
    or metrics, then the relativity may spread into other philosophical
    concepts, too. 
    -   Moreover, there will be normative conflicts:
        -   How to align our credences
        -   Which act to perform
        -   Whether someone has a certain duty ...

    -   If we have to solve the above problems by relativising norms,
        then we might think it's too high a price to pay for holding
        a particular concept of lawhood.

##### Language-Rigidity is too problematic, but Metrics-Rigidity is more plausible

-   If we rigidify our actual language, then both path and future
    scientists are likely to get the laws wrong. 
    -   That seems false, because we usualy think that future scientists
        are in a better position to get the laws right.

-   If we rigidify an ideal version of our language, then this account
    will have counterfactual component whose truth value needs to be
    evaluated using lawhood.
    -   But our job right now is to analyze lawhood in terms of the
        language. This make it *circular*.

-   Metrics-Ridigity, accounrd to Eddon and Meacham, seems to be on
    firmer ground. 
    
    > While it's plausible that the language of the future scientific
    > community will bear little resemblance to our current language,
    > it's less plausible that the metrics of the future scientific
    > community will bea little resemblance to our metrics of simplicity,
    > informativeness, balance, etc. (bottom of pg. 17)

-   But why think that? Why think that the future metrics will be similar
    to our current metrics? Here are some potential reasons:
    -   Current metrics in science resemble all past metrics in science
        (Aristotle and Newton).
    -   Current metrics in science resemble all past metrics in science 
        since the Enlightenment (Verificationism).
    -   We cannot conceive of a futre scientific community whose metrics
        bear little resemblance to current metrics in science. (If we are
        not supposing Metrics-Objectivity or some particular psychological
        facts about the members of the scientific community, how do we
        get this intuition?)
    -   Current emtrics in science seem to be not for from the objectively
        right metrics. (But we are not supposing Metrics-Objectivity.)

-   **Another worry**: There may not be a consensus on the current metrics
    in the scientific community. If we rigidify an ideal version of our current
    metrics, we will run into the circularity problem again.

##### What about Language-Salience

-   Language-Salience allows the candidate system to be formulated in
    any language, but it adds an extra component to the metrics,
    namely, salience.
    -   When evaluating the candidate systems, we use the metrics of
        informativness, balance, and salience to pick out the best system.
        -   The best system will *come in its own language*.

-   According to Eddon and Meacham, *saliance* means usefulness, unity,
    and explantory power.
    -   Presumably, they depend on certain psychological features of
        the assessors. This makes laws of nature depend on us.
        -   They nothice this worry and reply that it depends
            on which answer to the Metrics question we pair it with.

-   **Worry 1**: Suppose we pair together the Language-Salience and
    Metrics-Rigidity. We rigidify our current metrics of salience.
    -   To be consistent, we should not appeal to any objective 
        correctness of our current metrics.
    -   So it seems that the metrics of salience depends on us.
        -   Hence, best systemhood and lawhood also depend on us.

-   **Worry 2**: A deeper worry (also acknowledged) is about the 
    notion of *salience itself*. It *seems less clear* than the notions
    of *simplicity* and *informativeness*, although we disagree about
    conceptions of those.
    -   So how to flesh out salience is an open question on this reduction.
    -   At any rate, to keep the reductionist project consistent, fleshing
        out of these notions must avoid invoking naturalness, objectivity,
        or anything like that.

#### Extending the Account

-   Eddon and Meacham proposed an analysis of lawhood without using 
    naturalness. They would like to extend the proposal to other
    Lewisian analyses to alos avoid invoking perfectly natural
    properties. Here is their strategy:

    > 1.  Take the laws given by the system of true sentences that,
    >     given our present metrics, best balances simplicity, informativeness,
    >     and salience.
    > 2.  Take all and only the properties deonoted by the predicates appearing
    >     in these laws. Call them *surrogate properties*.
    > 3.  Wherever a Lewisian analysis invokes perfectly natural properties,
    >     subsitute these surrogates.

    -   **Example**: Lewisian analysis of duplication.
        -   *Original*: Two things are duplicates *iff* there is a bijection
            between their parts that preserves the perfectly natural
            properties and relations.
        -   *Modified*: Two things are duplicates *iff* there is a bijection
            between their parts that preserves the surrogate properties and
            relations.

-   Eddon and Meacham try to handle three main worries.

##### A chaotic world

-   The **argument**:
    1.  If the world is utterly chaotic, then there are no laws.
    2.  If there are no laws, then there are no surrogate properties.
    3.  If there are no surrogate properties, then the modification
        strategy does not work.
    4.  Therefore, if the world is utterly chaotic, then their strategy
        does not work.

-   The **response**: Their strategy takes the surrogates from the actual
    world; since the actual world is not so utterly chaotic, it works.
-   The **worry**: How do we know the actual world is not chaotic?
-   Perhaps a **better reply**: Why thing (1) is true?
    -   Even if the world is utterly chaotic, there will be many truths
        about the world, such as the "chaotic dynamics of the Universe."
    -   These truths can figure into the system that best balances the 
        relevant criteria of assesment.
        -   So there being no laws doesn't follow from there being much
            chaos.

    -   Moreover, many chaotic systems display a great extent of order,
        which may be law-governed.

##### Surrogates are not all instrinsic

-   Here is a locational property: *being two meters from an electron.*
    -   Suppose it is in the best system, then some surrogates will be
        extrinisic. But in Lewis's system, natural properties are intrinsic.
        They **reply**:
        1.  It is unlikely to appear in the actual best system. *Being two 
            meters from an electron* is less salient than *being two meters
            from*. (But isn't it still extrinisic?)
        2.  We might be wrong about intrinsicality.

##### Foreign properties

-   Surrogates are supposed to play the role of naturalness.
    -   Possible there are foreign properties not instantiated at
        the actual world.
        -   But surrogates are all from the actual world?
        -   So there will be objective dissimilarity that cannot
            be analyzed by surrogates.

February 14th, 2014 <small>Seminar</small>
------------------------------------------

-   Lewis has "spatio-temporal" manifolds, everything is determined
    by points in this (sometimes) perfectly natural properties.
    -   "Intrinsic to the regions which they specify."

-   For Lewis, the fundamental metaphysics of the world is determined
    by the decoration of the spatio-temporal manifold.
    -   The laws are determined by what best specifies the manifold.
        -   The best systemization is a language, whose predicates refer
            to the perfectly natural properties.

    -   You want to build a universe? Get a space-time manifold, get
        perfectly natural properties and decorate your manifold.

-   **Problem**: It is a possibility that there is a best systemization
    whose language's predicates do not refer to perfectly natural
    properties.
    -   In fact, if you compare it to the BSA with predicates that
        have perfectly natural properties, the system *without* it
        even looks better.

-    This seems opposed to Lewis' project, so:
    -   *Is it really a problem for Lewis?*
    -   *Is there something within Lewis' overall view to deal with it?*
    -   *Working out the alternative, you have to say something about
        what counts as laws.*

-   There two ways of specifying what it takes for a world:
    -   Fundamental properties and space-time
    -   *Just a world*
        -   Where it's the project of science to pick out what
            the fundamental structures of the world are.

-   **Loewer on Similarity**: Our notions about similarity are informed
    by properties which can be picked out by physics.

### Semantics of "Law" and Laws

> **Daniel**: This view is really useful when I'm doing this thing,
> and this other theory is useful when I'm doing this thing. Lets
> *roll with the relativism*.
>
> -   **Response**: I *do not* want to go that way.
>    -   There has to be at least *really one* if we can "pick our
>        favorite."
>
> -   **Mike**: This means laws will give you contradicting advice.
> -   **Niko**: I thought Daniel's worry was that the fundamentality
>     is relativied to communities with interests. By picking a "select"
>     community, you're not helping.
> -   **Loewer**: The word isn't realtivised to the community, it's that
>     the very idea of scientific law is one in which the content is determined
>     by the practice of our scientific community.

#### What to take away

-   Two pictures of fundamental properties:
    1.  Lewis picture: Epistemic worry, best theories which don't pick
        out single sets of laws.

### Armstrong's Critique of RT

-   He beats a horse he thinks he's killed.
    -   Props up *Naive* RT

-   Armstrong is interested in:
    -   "It is a law that Fs are Gs."
    -   "Fs make it *x* probable that Gs ..."

-   Assuming you have lawful generalizations, Armstrong thinks that the Humean
    account fails dreadfully.
-   His objections:
    -   HU that are not laws.
    -   Laws that are not HUs.

-   "Clearly this isn't right."
-   Armstrong thinks there are *vacuous* (uninstantiated) laws.
-   Armstrong also thinks that HU is not necessary for lawhood.
-   Interested for methodological reasons.
-   Tooley's garden.
    -   Tooley's intuition is that it is law but not a HU,
        because it is limited to Smith's garden.

### Presentation <small>by Megan Feeney</small>

#### Background on Armstrong's theory of universals

-   Armstrong appeals to a theory of universals he developers in
    his 1978 work *Universals and Scienctific Realism*. Different
    theories of universals will place different constraints on
    accounts of natural laws as relations between universals.

Principle of instantiation

:   -   Only real particulars have properties and relations, so
        only real particulars instantiate universals.
        -   Armstrong accepts actualism but rejects presentism. 
            The real paticulars are actual entities from the past,
            present, and future. So accord to the principle of
            instantiation, there are no universals uninstantiated by
            actual things.
        -   Principle of instantiation is supposed to be naturalistically
            motivated.

-   For Armstrong, what the laws are in a world will depend on what universals
    are instantiated in that world. We'll return to this.

Principle of rejection of bare particulars

:   Particulars (like universals) do not exist independantly of
    actual states of affairs.

-   The bare particular and uninstantiated universal are "vicious
    abstractions" from states-of-affairs and are metaphysically
    impossible. Particularity and universality, however, are non-vicious
-   We determine the universals *a posteriori* "on the basis of total
    science" (pg. 83). If our final science involved laws with negative
    or disjunctive predicates, I suspect that Armstrong would say that
    it had failed to discover universals, (maybe that the science was the
    best we could do, but not ideal). He wants to be a full-fledged realist
    about universals.
-   Many general predicates do not express universal. For example, *being a
    game* probably doesn't express a universal because there is not something
    identical in all games that makes them games.
-   On Armstrong's view, there are no dijusctive or negative universals.
    But there are conjectuive universals. Conjuctionive universals, but not
    disjunctive or negative universals, can caputre the role that universals
    play in causal explanations and the sense in which all the particulars
    that instatiate a universal (roughly) must have something in common.
-   For Armstrong, a relation between universals holds always an everywhere
    within a world. It cannot happen that a universal *F* bears relation *R*
    to *G* at some time and places, but not others. That's because a universal
    is the same (identical) wherever/whenever it is instantiated; it is wholly
    present in its instantiations (pg. 79). However, universal will be related
    in different possible worlds.

#### Natural laws as necessitation relations between universals

-   Armstrong offers the following account of natural laws:

    > (1) It is a law of nature that Fs are Gs iff N(F, G).

-   Fness and Gness are first-order universals.
    -   N is a second-order necessitation relation that holds between
        first-order universals.
    -   It is a relation of contingent rather than logical necessitation.
        -   So N(F, G) symbolizes the state-of-affairs of the relation
            N holding between Fness and Gness.

-   N(F, G) entails the state of the corresponding Humean uniformity,
    baring for now any *ceteris paribus* worries:

    > (2) $N(F, G) \to (x)(Fx \supset Gx)$

-   But a stament of a Humean uniformity does not entail that the 
    corresponding necessitation holds:

    > (3) $\lnot ((x)(Fx \supset Gx) \to N(F, G))$

-   "$\supset$" is the material conditional. It is an important question what
    "$\to$" symbolizes
-   Three worries about the entailment relation between N(F, G) and
    $(x)(Fx \supset Gx)$ in 2.
    1.  David Lewis proposes the following **dilemma**:
        -   **First horn**: On one hand, the entailment might hold because
            because (2) would be better expressed by some other logical form.
            in that case, we could replace "$\to$" with the material condition.
            -   For example, perhaps 2 should be expression as $(P \land Q) \to P$,
                where *P* is a statement of the Humean uniformity.
            -   But then what is Q? Or perhaps the trugl logical form is
                $P \to (O \lor Q)$. But it is unclear how to translate 2 into
                this form.

        -   **Second horn**: If 2 is not better expressed by some other logical
            form, it seems that we must say that the entailment obtains in virtue
            of an *additional metaphysical necessity relation*, holding between
            *N(F, G)* and the Humean uniformity. But this new necessity
            relation is *mysterious*! Is it primitive or does it hold in virtue
            of something else?

    2.  One might also worry whether Armstrong's account is substantive. What is
        the necessitation relation besides that which is required to ensure 
        uniformities, whatever "ensure" means?
    3.  There are different kinds of uniformities;
        -   It might be that all Fs are Gs, that not Fs are Gs, that if one
            kind of thing is an F, then another kind of thing is a G. How
            can N(F, G) explain diferent kinds of uniformities if N is a single
            relation?

-   In a way, these three worries are closely related. Armstrong hopes to
    appeal to the laws to explain the uniformities. 
    -   But if the laws are to do this explanatory work, Amrstrong
        must say something infromative about how the laws "produce" or "ensure"
        that the unformities hold.
        -   Much of the chapter concerns this
        
#### Laws as first-irder universals

-   Armstrong ultimately takes the necessiation relation (N) to be
    primitive.
-   Howver, he hopes that its primitiveness will be less mysterious
    if we think of N(F, G) not only as the state of affairs of
    necessitation relation holding between two universals, but
    also a complex, first order universal itself. 
    -   He also hopes that treating N(F, G) as a universal
        will provide at least a partial solution to the entailment
        worry.

-   What kind of think is N(F, G)?
    -   First, it is a second-order state of affairs. It involves
        first-order universals (Fness and Gness) falling under a second
        order 
    -   Armstrong holds that N(F, G) is also a cmoplex, *first-order*
        universal.
        -   In particular, it is a dyadic relation between first-order
            relation between first-order states of affairs. It is
            instantiated by positive instance of the law.

    -   An examples of a positive instance of the law, 

        > (N(F, G))(*a*'s being F, *a*'s being G)

-   How is treating laws as first-order universal supposed to clairfy the
    relation between laws and uniformities?
    -   Armstrong wants to assimilate the relation between laws and their
        positive instantiations. Thus, a Humean uniformity is the collection
        of all the positive instantiations of the corresponing law, understood
        as instantiations of a first-order universal.
    -   Any mystery surrounding the instantiation relatino wouldn't be a problem
        facing Armstrong's thoeyr of laws *per se*. It would be a more general 
        mystery facing realists about univerals.

-   Three potential difficulties:
    1.  How illuminating is this solution? Do we now better understand the
        relationship between laws and uniformitites? The necessitation relation
        is still primitive.
        -   "This reproach is just, I think, but the inexplicability of
            necessitation just has to be accepted" because it is
            explanatorily indispendible (pg. 92).
        -   But maybe we can still get an independent grasp on necessitation
            (next section). At this point, Armstrong still thinks he can
            say more about the entailment.

    2.  Is the solution *ad hoc*? Does treating laws of nature as first-order
        universals make other substantiated predictions? Is its sole motivation
        to allay the entailment worry?
        -   Armstrong suggests that treating laws as first-order universals
            explns in what sense laws are abstract.
            -   Laws are abastractions because they are relations between
                universals, which themselves are abstract.
            -   Universals are abstract, for Armstrong, because they obey
                the *principle of instantiation*, that is, they do not exit
                indendantly from actual states of affairs.
            -   By holding that laws are first-order universals, Armstrong
                can explain what they are abstraction *from*: their
                positive instantiations.

        -   The explanation depends on the controversial principle of instantiation,
            rejected by Platonists.
            -   If we deny this principle, then we also deny that the abstractness of
                laws in Armstrong's sense is something that needs to be explained.

    3.  It is logically kosher for N(F, G) to express both a state of affairs, which
        is well-formed by itself, and a universal, which requires arguments?

#### Singular causation, singular necessitation, and the "independant fix"

-   Armstrong holds that purely singular causal connections are logically
    impossible.
    -   Suppose it's *a*'s becoming F causes *b* to become G. Must this
        be an instance of some F to G law?
    -   For Armstrong, it is only an instance of an F to G law if *a*'s 
        becoming G *in virtue of universals F and G*.
        -   But it is logically possible that *a*'s becoming F causes
            *b* to become G not in veritue of the universals.
        -   It ould just be a matter of this particular event causing
            that particular event.

-   Thus, purely singular necessitations are logically possible
    -   Causation cannot be indentified with necessitation because
        there are cases of necessitation that are not cases of causation.
        -   But purely singular causation would be a case of purely
            singular necessitation.

    -   It is logically possible that:
        1.  It is not a law that Fs are Gs, and
        2.  *a*'s becoming F necessitates *a*'s becoming G and,
        3.  *b*'s becoming F necessitates *b*'s becoming H, (where being a G is
            incompatible with being an H, and *a* is not *b*).

-   Armstrong suggests that we now have an indepedant grup on the necessitation relation
    and the mysterious entailment between laws and uniformities.
    -   The necessitation relation is N(F, G) is the same as the necessitation
        relation operative in cases of singular necessitation.
        -   Is the notion of singular necessitation more perspicuous than the
            notion of necessitation between universals?

    > It is clear then that *if such a relation holds between universals*,
    > then it is automatic that each particular F determines that it is
    > a G. That is just the instantiation of the universal N(F, G) is
    > particulars cases. **(pg. 97)**

    -   What role does singular necessitation play in this explanation?
        The key idea here seems to be that laws are first-order universals.

#### Some advantages and disadvantages of Armstrong's view

##### Difficulties

-   We want to admit that there are some uninstantiated natural laws.
    But if laws are relations between universals, and there are no
    universals that are uninstanted in the actual world, we might
    wonder how Amrstrong's view can accommodate uninstantiated laws.
    -   **Response**: Strictly speaking, there are no uninstantiated
        laws, but we can ask what laws *would* hold in counterfactual
        situations.

-   How will Armstrong's theory account for **Smith's garden case**?
    -   **Response**: We will introduce *quasi-universals*.
        -   Being a fruit grown in Smith's garden. These are repeatable
            features of the world whose predicates involve esnetial
            reference to particulars.
        -   Armstrong's view mau be too permissive if necessitation 
            relations between quasi-universals and universals count
            as natural laws.
            -   He may only want to acknowledge those quasi-universals
                "required for a law," but which ones are those?

##### Advantages

-   We can appeal to the law N(F, G) to explain the existence of
    corresponding **Humean uniformity**. The naive regularity theory,
    by contrast, indentifies the law with the Humean uniformity
    and so cannot explain twhy the uniformity obtains.
-   Armstrong may have a way around the **paradoxes of confirmation**.
    -   Armstrong suggests that an observation confirms a law that Fs are
        Gs iff the law explains the observation.
    -   Both F/Gs and non-F/non-Gs are explains by the law and so confirm
        the law, although the latter have less confirmatory
        strength than the former.
        -   But non-F/Gs do not confirm the law, because their
            observation would not be explained by the law.

-   The laws as relations between universals account can explain why
    laws support counterfactuals.
     -   When it is a lw that Fs are Gs, the necessiation relation
         between Fness and Gness ensures that, were *x* to be added
         to the calss of Fs, it would be a G (of necessity)
         -   **Caveat**: The counterfactual is true iff the closest
             worl where *x* is F is not some distant world where the
             actual laws (and in particular the law that Fs are Gs)
             do not hold.

-   Armstrong's theory may be able to explain why inductive inference is 
    rational.
    -   Inductive inference from confirming instances to the laws is a
        species of *inference to the best explanation*.
    -   Insofar as inference to the best explannation is rational,
        inductive inference is rational.

### Discussion

-   Armstrong thinks that regularity accounts has terrible problems with induction.
    -   Loewer thinks otherwise.

-   Imagine a world call a "Humean-world" where there only l-laws, and these bring
    about l-causation and l-counterfactuals.
-   Simple form from John Airman
    -   Think about a world where there's only one particle, and it's moving
        uniformly.
    -   This is a world where the Newtonian mechanics obtain.
    -   But the BSA under simplicity will just describe the one particle.

-   Our concept of law is funny because it has the idea of governing and because
    of Lewis's best system account.
    -   The governing part seperates the fact from the law.
    -   As long it's logically compatible, but they might not be compatible ...
        on Lewis' account.
    -   This is the beginning of the main worry behind Lewis's account of chance.

-   If you remove a particle from a universe, then the laws should stay the same.
    -   Maybe it's vague.
    -   Maybe it's not true.
    -   Maybe there must be *at least* one.

-   There are intuitions that we have that are anti-Humean, and some of this arises
    from theological explanations of laws.
-   We have some grip of whats going on in the theological

-   Here are two views of fundamental ontology
    1.  There is the Humean mosaic, space-time structure manifold, and it's decorated
        with fundamental properties and maybe it satisfies HS. *And that's it.* Things
        supervene on this (???).
    2.  Fundamental state of the world and fundamental laws, which are entities over
        and above the categorical facts, as they take the state of universe at any
        given time, and determine the next state.

-   Changing the facts doesn't always change the laws, but changing the laws will
    always change the facts.
-   Could the best system of the whole history of the universe that the laws enfored
    in this spatio-temporal region and then there are these laws in another spatio-
    temporal region, it's a bit awkward.
    -   I don't see *in pricniple* problem to this, however.

### Introduction

-   It'd be nice for metaphysics to hand over its problems to physics.
    -   Usually if you're a clever metaphysicist you can find any argument in
        physics which rebuts your metaphysics.
    -   Different views of temporal passage run afoul of relativity theory.

-   One of the fun things metaphyscicians can do is spell out the various
    metaphysical commitments of various physical theories.
    -   A great example is quantum theories, which "wear their ontology on their
        sleeve."

-   Lewis has a fairly spare ontology.
    -   Subsintivalism about spacetime.
    -   Metric structure
    -   Decorated by:
        -   Natural properties 
        -   Instantiated points
        -   No natural relations

-   Maudlin has a different ontology
    -   He also has spacetime.
    -   He thinks there's an "intrinsic direction to time."
        -   This makes it different from space.
        -   He sometimes says that "time passes" or "time flows."

        > There are a bunch of features of our world which support talking about time like
        > this. You can change now what lunch you'll have today but you can't change now
        > what you had for lunch earlier. You know more about your lunch earlier than you
        > do about your lunch later.

    -   Fundamental FLOTE
    -   Objective probabilities

-   This is a sparse ontology because we have things like "late trains."
-   What seems to be missing are those things like "qualia."
-   Both are physicalists, both take lessons from physics, but different ones.
-   Maudlin thinks that fundamental laws are bedrock ontology, Lewis doesn't.
    -    I think these are possibilia for Lewis.

-   For Maudlin, laws ar ein the fundamental stuff of the universe and make for
    the regualirity.
    -   Tim thinks that the practice of physics supposrts his pucture.
    -   And of course, we do have this idea of "temporal direction."

-   The puzzle for Maudline, right at the surface, is what are the laws and what
    work do they do?
    -   This makes Loewer stubborn about accepting his view.

### Comments on "Quantum Entaglment, Bohmian Mechanics, and HS" by Eddy Chen

#### The Probem of Quantum Entaglement

-   In standard non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we represent a physical system as 
    a normalized vector in the Hilbert Space
    -   A unit vector in a complex-valued vector space with an inner product which
        satisfies a set of axioms.
    -   States of individual particles A and B can be represented as $\ket{\phi}_A$
        and $\ket{\psi}_B$.
        -   The state of a pair of particles A and B can be representated as 
            $\ket{\Psi}_{AB}$.

> Spin is a property of an electron and how it moves in a magentic field, it's an
> interesting feature if a particle that they'll be a certain probability of how it'll
> move.

-   Two particles are *not entagled* when their joint state is *seperable* as the
    tensore production of their individual states:

    $$\ket{\Psi}_{AB} = \ket{\psi}_A \oplus \ket{\phi}_B$$

> What's strange and novel here is that the state gives all the information about
> the features we're interested. There's an indetermincy.

-   Two are *entangled* when their joint state is *not seperable* as the tensor product
    of their individual states:

    $$\ket{\Psi}_{AB} \not =  \ket{\psi}_A \oplus \ket{\phi}_B$$

-   Suppose that $\ket{\Psi}_{AB}$ is the intrinsic property of the pair A and B, and
    $\ket{\phi}_A$ and $\ket{\psi}_B$ are the intrinsic properties of particles A and B,
    then we seem to have a case of the failure of HS.
    -   It remains to explore precisely *which* component of HS fails in this case of
        quantum entaglement.
        -   A worry, of course, is whether we should interpret the states represented
            in Hilbert Space as instrinsic properties to the systems.
        -   More on this later, from the perspectives of Bohmian Mechanics and
            C-Algebra.

#### Which Component of Humean Supervenience is the Target?

Separability

:   The complete physical state of the world is determined by (supervenes on) the
    intrinsic physical state of each space-time point (or each pointlike object)
    and the spatio-temporal relation between those points.

-   The challenge to **Separability** comes from observations of entaglement
    phenomena such as the case above.
    -   Moreover, Maudlin and many other philosophers of physics think that realism
        about quantum mechanics commit us to the following thesis:

Metaphysical Holism

:   There exist some whole whose intrinsic properties fails to supervene on the
    intrinsic properties of its fundamental (point-sized) constiuent parts plus
    their spatiotemporal relations.

-   Notice, the first thesis mentions the copmlete physical state of the world, while
    second only mentions the existence of some quantum whole, possibly distinct from
    the entire world.
    -   The implicit reasoning to their incompatibility, perhaps, is that any system
        (such as the entire world) containing such a quantum whole would fail to
        supervene on the instrinsic properties of some of its fundamental parts.

-   Miller's goal, I take it, is to show that a commited Humean can embrace
    **Metaphysical Holism** and retain **Separability**, by adoptiing the de 
    Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics. 
    -   Her task, if it succeeds, can show the logical consistency and empiral
        adequacy of embracing both theses.

#### A Brief Tour through Bohmian Mechanics

-   The de-Broglie-Bogm interpretation of quantum mechanics, sometimes called Bohmian
    mechanics, is an empirally adequate and mathematically elegant interpretation of
    the quantum formlism. Importantly
    1.  **Its dynamics is entiraly deterministic.**
        -   As for the dynamics, it adds a (explicitly non-local) guiding equation to
            the Shrodinger equation.
        -   The Shrodinger equation determines the evolution of the wave function,
            while the guiding equation "looks at the wave function and the 
            configurations of all other particles" and "completes" the dynamic
            determinations by specifying the velocties of the particles.

    2.  Given the Quantum Equilibrium Hypothesis, **it predicts that there is an
        appearance of randomness in the world**.
    3.  It predicts a probabilitic distribution conforming to the Born Rule.
    4.  It predicts the impossibility ("absolute uncertainty") about gaining informaiton
        more than the probilistic distributino of Born Rule, agreeing with the 
        Kocken-Specker theorem.
    5.  It permits both a N-particle-in-3D-space ontology and a 1-particle-3N-space
        ontology.

-   In a typical Stern-Gerlach measurement of particle A having spin-up state, a Bohmian
    would say that it is for A and other particles within the system and within the
    universe as a whole ot be moving in such away as to be certain to produce "up"
    indication among the particles of the Stern-Gerlach device.
    -   That is $\ket{\uparrow}_{A,t}$ just means (for a Bohmian) that, given the
        initial condition of the universe, particle A is traveling through spacetime
        at time t and is accompandied by other particles on the measure device
        registering the "up" outcome.
    -   The attribution of the spin-up state to particle A is not about the intrinsic
        state of A but its present and future motions as well as other particle's
        present and future motions. To summarize the Bohmian idea:

Bohmian Realism
:   The state of a system represents a relational property, not an intrinsic property
    of the system.

-   Based on this principle, one can make an immediate reply to the argument for
    non-separability: quantum entaglement is not about intrinsic properties, and it
    no indication of a failure of whole-to-part superveinience of intrinsic properties,
    thus it is in no violation of **Separability**.
    -   But that's too quick. There is still the pilot wave that fails to supervene
        on particles.

#### How to be a Humean about the Pilot Wave?

##### Be a 3N-Space Bohmian

-   Consider our N-Particle system in 3D space.
    -   It can be represented by a 1-Particle system in 3N space, where N is the number
        of particles in 3D space.
    -   3N space is the space of all possible configuartions of N-Particle in 3D space.

3N-Space Bohmianism
:   3N space is the fundamental space; 3D space is not fundmental, if not "illusory."

3N-Space Bohmianism + Humeanism
:   Fundamentally there are no pilot waves. The universal wave function is fundamental.
    It is a field in the 3N space (the fundamental physical space), and it supervenes on
    the amplitutde and phase at each point in the 3N space.

-   **Disadvantage**: The loss of primitive ontology and 3D space. The confusion of the
    represnetation and the things represented.

##### Be a 3D-Space Bohmian; Go Nomic about the Wave Function

-   The world is fundamentally 3-dimensional. The universal wave function and its
    guiding equation express a fundamental law of physics.

3D-Space Bohmianism
:   Fundamentally, the world is 3D and there are many particles.

Nomic 3D Bohmianism
:   The unviersal wave function is a law of nature rather than a physical object.

-   But in addition to **Separability**, HS also has the following component:

Physical Statism
:   All facts about the world, including modal and *nomological* facts, are determined
    by its total physical state.

-   This seems to be violated by **Nomic 3D Bohmianism**, if the wave function does 
    not supervene on the mosaic. A Humean reply:

BSA applied to the Wave Function
:   The univesal wave function is contained in the best summary of the Humean mosaic
    that balances simplicity, strength, and other criteria. Statements about the wave
    function are fundmentally statements about the entire four-dimensional Humean i
    mosaic.

##### Worries and Questions

1.  Is the vafe function simple? The effective wave function of the subsystem, being
    gerrymandered and complicated, is not simple. But there is hope that the universal
    wave function is simple.
2.  Is the wave function law-like? The effective wave function of the subsystem, being
    time-dependant and controllable, is not law-lie. But there is hope that the 
    universal wave functionis stationary and uncrotrollable. The hope comes from 
    observations of the form of the Wheeler-Dewitt equation (3) togetget with the
    Schrodinger equation (4):

    $$H \ket{\Psi} = 0$$
    $$i h \frac{d}{dt} \ket{\Psi} = H \ket{Psi}$$

    But isn't that too much to hope sine (3) is only a *guess* about how to quantize
    gravity? Also, there can be multiple soltion to (3), but we believe there is a
    unique universal wave function.
3.  A general worry about Bohmian Mechanics: the challenge from relativity and
    Lorentz-invariance.
4.  Another general worry: the challenge from superficiality features in physics to
    BSA.
5.  A more general worry: being a realist about QM doesn't automatically comit one to 
    be a realist about the wave function. In elementary QM, there is a state space
    representated by the Hilbert space; there are also properties of the states 
    sometimes represented by the Operators on the Hilbert space. In algebraic QFT, 
    however, there is no unique way to represented the state space, several alternative
    representations are available and each representation has to "mentaion" the other
    alternatives, What is being represented, in this case, seems to be common core -
    the properties of the states, represeted by the C-Algebra. This seems to question
    the motivated of state-space realism, heance wave-function realism, hence the 
    entaglement problem for HS as well as the reply to solve the problem.

March 14th, 2013 <small>"Humean Supervenience Debugged" Outline</small>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

Humean supervience
:   The thesis that the whole truth about a world like ours supervenes on the 
    spatiotemporal distribution of local qualities.

> There is one big bad bug: chance. It is here, and here alone, that I fear defeat.

-   But Lewis thinks he can now beat the bug. Here's the roadmap:
    1.  Reviewing old ground, reintroduce Humean supervenience.
    2.  What might a Humean analysis of chance look like?
    3.  Why is chance a problem for Humean analyses?
    4.  Why are unHumean answers are not acceptable refuge?
    5.  The beginning of a solution that plagues the Humean analyses. Why is it not 
        good enough?
    6.  The *good news*: How to complete the solution.

> The resulting rescue of Humean chance won't give us all we might wish, but I think
> it gives us enough.

### Humean Supervenience

-   We may be certain *a priori* that any contigent truth whatever is made true,
    somehow, by the pattern of instantiation of fundamental properties and relations
    by particular things.
    -   That is, that truth is supervienient on being.
    -   If two possible worlds are discernible in any way, it must be because they
        differ in what things are in them or how those things are.
        -   "How things are" is fully given by the fundamental, perfectly natural
            properties and relations that those things instantiate.

-   As an anti-haecceitist, Lewis would drop the "what things there are" clause,
    instead, *all contigent truth supervenes just on the pattern of coinstatiation*.
    -   Some will wish to add other fundamental properties or relations, like:
        -   Armstrong's immanent universals.
        -   William's families of exactly representing tropes.

    -   We may reasonably hope that physics will give the inventory of the perfectly
        natural properties and relations of this world.

-   Humean supervinience is another speculative addition to the thesis that
    truth supervenes on being.
    -   It says that the fundamental relations are exactly the spatiotemporal ones.
    -   It says that in worlds like ours, the fundamental properties are local qualities
        -   Perfectly natural intrinsic properties of points.
        -   Or of point-sized occupants of points.

    -   All else supervenes on the spatiotemporal arrangement of local qualities
        throughout all of history, past, present, and future.

-   Humean supervenience is inspired by classical physics, but physics isn't classical
    anymore.
    -   The point of defending Humean supervenience is not to support reactionary
        physics, but resist the philosophical arguments that there are more things
        in heaven and earth than physics has dreamt of.
    -   Lewis is defending the *philosophical* tenability of Humean Supervenience.

-   But even classical physics raises a question for Humean Supervenience.

    > Is a vector field an arrangement of local qualities?
    
    -   Lewis said that qualities were intrinsic, that means they can never differ
        between duplicates; and two things can be duplicates even if they point in
        different directions.

-   Humean supervenience is meant to be *contigent*.
    -   It says that among *worlds like ours* no two differ without difference in the
        arrangement in qualities.
    -   But when is a world like ours?
        -   Lewis used to say: "When it's a world of the 'inner-sphere', free of
            fundamental properties or relations that are alien to our world."
        -   But this probably wont do.

    -   On the **Armstrong spinning sphere** or the **Kripke spinning disk**:
        -   One *lesson*: One way to get a difference between worlds with the exact
            same arrangment of local qualities is to have things bilocated in spacetime.
        -   Take two worlds containing spheres of homogenous matter, the only difference
            being that one is spinning. 
        -   The arrangement of local qualities is just the same.
        
            > The difference between the spinning and the stationary sphere is a
            > difference in the pattern of bilocation.

        -   No worries fo Humean Supervenience, because Lewis believes our worlds to
            be a "temporal-parts-world", and therefore neither of the worlds in the
            story is like ours.

### Symmetry and frequency

#### Chance and credence

Chance
:   Objective single-case probability. For example, 50% is the probability that a certain
    particular tritium atom will decay sometime in the next 12.26 years.

Credence
:   Degree of belief, and notably not the same as *chance*.

-   But chance is connected to credence: if a rational believe knew that a chance of
    an event was 50%, then almost no matter what else he might or might not know as
    well, he would believe to the degree 50% that the event would occur.
-   If Humean Supervenience is true, then contigent truths about chance are in the same
    boat as all other contigent truths.
    -   They must be made true by the spatiotemporal arrangement of local qualities.
    -   How might this be?
        -   The Principal Principle requires that the chancemaking pattern in the
            arrangement of local qualities must be something that would, if known,
            correspondingly constrain rational credence.
        -   That is, that *whatever makes it true* that the chance is 50% must
            also be *whatever makes it rational* to believe to degree 50% that the
            event will occur.

#### Chance-makers and the indifference principle

-   Two candidates for chance-makers: *symmetries* and *frequencies*.
    -   On symmetries:

        > Suppose a drunkard is wandering through a maze of T-junctions, and at each
        > junction we can find nothing that looks like a relevant difference between
        > the case that he turns left an the case that he truns right. We could well
        > understand if rational credence had to treat the cases alike, for the lack
        > of relevant difference. If the symmetry is something that would, if known,
        > constrain credence, then it is suitable to serve as a chancemaker.

        -   The *principle of indifference*.

-   An unrestricted principle of indifference is inconsistent.
    -   With alternative cases of ingeniously hoked-up properties, you can get it to
        say anything you like.
    -   But assume that you can somehow distinguish between that nonsense and then
        limit the principle only to natural properties. You get only natural
        partitions.

#### Symmetries as chance-makers

-   Some *reservations* about symmetries as chance-makers.
    1.  There is no reason to think that we have symmetries to underlie the chance 
        phenomena that we there there are.

        > It would be nice to think that each tritium atom contains a tiny drunkard
        > in a maze of symmetrical T-junctions.

    2.  Symmetries are only defeasible constrainers of rational credence. Therefore,
        they can only be *defeasible chance-makers*.

        > The symmetry of the T-junctions would no longer require 50-50 division of 
        > credence if we also knew that, despite this symmetry, the drunkard turns
        > right nine times out of ten.

#### Frequencies as chance-makers

-   Now it looks as though *frequencies* are the *real chance-makers*.
    
    Frequency
    :   A pattern in the spatiotemporal arrangement of qualities.

    -   We can well understand how known frequencies could constrain rational credence.

-   *Again*, this will be worse than useless if we can't distinguish natural from
    gerrymandered kinds, and *again*, we could get any answer we liked.
    -   But we can do it! And nature has been kind to us.

        > Large chance systems seem to be put together out of many copies of very small
        > chance systems; and very small chance system often do come in enormous classes
        > of exact copies. **You see on tritium atom, you've seen them all.**

#### Problems for frequentism

-   Lewis thinks this simple frequency analysis is *near enough right*, but *has limits*.
    -   It is only plausible when we do have the enormous classes of exact copies.
    -   It has difficulty analyzing **unobtainium**.
        -   Consider $\mathrm{unobtainium}^{346}$.
        -   It's hard to make the stuff, in all of space and time there have been only
            two.
        -   One had a lifetime of 4.8 microsecond, and the other a life of 6.1 
            microsecond.

-   Further, consider $\mathrm{ubobtainium}^{349}$. The isotope is even harder to make,
    and there isn't a single instance of it through space and time.
    -   Its frequency of decay in a given time is undefind, 0/0.
    -   If there's any *truth* about its *chance* of decay, this undefined frequency
        cannot be the *truthmaker*.

-   The problem of unobtainium may make us think that it's not about *frequencies
    in the actual world*, but rather *counterfactual situations* where unobtainium
    is abundant.

-   Another **problem** for *simple frequentism*:

    > If spacetime is finite and chance system get only just so small, then all
    > frequencies are rational numbers. Yet the great majority of real numbers are
    > irrational, and we have no pre-philosophical reason to doubt that chances in
    > a finite world can take irrational values.

-   The **answer** to the *problem of unobtainium* is remembering that single-case
    chances follow from *general probabilistic laws of nature*.
    -   There are general *laws* of radioactive decay that apply to *all atoms*.
    -   Unobtainium atoms have their chances of decay *not* in virtue of decay
        frequencies for unobtainium, but rather in virtue of these general *laws*.

#### Onwards to laws

-   The appeal to laws only postpones the problem of chance.
    -   What pattern in the arrangement of qualities makes the chances?
    -   So we must now turn to a Humean analysis of laws, and make them probabilistic.

### The best-system analysis of law

#### Improving Ramsey's Best Systems Account

> [Laws are] consequences of those propositions which we should take as axioms if we
> knew everything and organized it as simply as possible in a deductive system. --- Ramsey

-   Lewis expands the definition like so:
    -   Take all deductive systems whose theorems are true.
    -   Some are *simpler*, better *systemiztized* than others.
    -   Some are *stronger*, more *informative* than others.
    -   These virtues compete: An uninformative system can be very simple and an
        unsystemiztized compendium of miscellaneous infromation can be information.
        -   The best sytem is the one that strikes as *good* a *balance* as *truth
            will allow* between simplicity and strength.
        -   How good this is will depend how kind nature has been.

> A regularity is a law if and only if it is a theorem of the best system.

#### Some complaints

-   Lewis thinks thats Armstrong and van Fraassen are question begging.
    -   If you think that theorems of the best system are laws, then you should
        also think:
        -   Underlie causal explanations;
        -   Support counterfactuals
        -   Are not mere coincidences;
        -   That they and their consequences are necessary;
        -   That they are confirmed by their instances.

    -   Others are more worrying. For instance, like any regularity theory, the 
        best-system analysis says that "laws hold in virtue of patterns spread over
        all space and time."
        -   *If* laws underlie causations, *then* we are wrong to think that causal
            roles of brain states are an entirely local matter.
        -   Unpleasant surprise, but Lewis *bites the bullet*.

#### The worst problem: standards

-   Where do the *standards* of simplicity and strength come from?
    -   It *seems* to be from us. But that can't be right!
    -   If we don't like the laws of nature, we can chance the laws, and make
        them always *have been* different, just by changing the way we think!
        -   "Positive thinking."

    -   Lewis uses to think that *rigidification* solved the problem.
        -   That you don't use hypothetical new stands, but rather the actual
            and present standards.
        -   This is *cosmetic only*, Lewis now thinks. It only makes the problem
            harder to state.

-   The **answer**: If nature is kind to us, the problem needn't arise.
    -   Simplicity and strength are partly a matter of psychology.
    -   It's not because of how we think that:
        -   A linear function is simpler than a quartic or step function
        -   A short alternation of prenex quantifiers is simpler than a longer
            one.

    -   *If* nature is kind, *then* the best system will be *robustly* best.
        -   *If* nature *were* unkind and disagreeing rival system were running
            neck-and-neck, *then* lawhood might be psychological.

    -   This trouble is with unkind nature, not on Lewis' analysis.
        -   Cross the bridge when we get there.

#### Onwards to probabilistic laws

-   So far we don't have probabilistic laws.
    -   *If* we had chances, *then* we could put them into the axioms of the best
        system and go about our day.
        -   But we don't.

> We decided that the chance-making patterns in the arrangement of qualities had to
> include the lawmaking patterns for the probabilistic laws that determine the chances
> in all the different cases.

### The best-system analysis of law and change together

#### The solution: fit

-   Modify the best-system analysis to make it deliver the chances and the laws in
    one "package deal."
    -   Take all deductive systems that pertain not only history, but also to
        what the various outcomes are in various situations (like the decay 
        probabilities).
    -   Require these system to be true about history.
    -   You cannot require anything about chances, because we don't know what that is.

-   Some of these system will *fit* the actual course of history better than others.
    -   The chance of that course of history will be higher according to some systems
        than according to others.

-   The **virtues** of *simplicity*, *strength*, and *fit* trade off.
    -   The best system is the system that get the best balance of all three.
    -   But now some of the laws are probabilistic!
        -   We can now analyze chance: "The chances are what the probabilistic laws
            of the best system say they are."

-   Like before, Lewis *hopes* that the best system is far ahead of the rest in terms
    of how *robust* it is so that the laws aren't dependent on us.
    -   The prospect is best if the the chance events aren't too few or too trivial.

#### Homogeneity

-   In the simplest case, the best-system *reduces to* frequentism.
    -   Suppose all chance events fall into one large and homogeneous class: 
        -   to fall silent about the chances of these events would cost too much 
            to strength.
        -   to assign equal single-case chances that differed from the actual probability
            would cost too much to fit.

    -   We get the best fit by equating chances to the frequency
        -   The larger the class is, the more so.

-   Suppose the class isn't very large, and that the frequency is close to a simple
    value, say 50-50.
    -   *Then* the system assigns uniform chances of 50% exactly gain *simplicity* and
        doesn't lose too much *fit*.

-   Suppose the class is *not homogenous*.
    -   Then, "a system that assigns unequal chances in different subclasses will gain
        greatly in fit at not too much cost in simplicity."

-   This is how we get the decay chances for $\mathrm{Un}^{346}$ and even for
    $\mathrm{Un}^{349}$, in virtue of chancemaking patterns that don't involve
    decay frequencies for unobtainium itself.
-   But this is not epistemology!
    -   *This is how nature determines what's true about the laws and chances.*

-   And this version of BSA, we can fix the big bad bug!

### Undermining

#### What is chance undermining?

-   *Suppose* we have a Humean analysis which says that present chances supervene
    upon the whole of history, future, past, and present (but not upon the past
    and present alone).
    -   *Then* different alternative future histories would determine different
        present chances.
    -   Further *suppose* that the differences between these alternative futures are
        differences in the outcomes of present of future chance events.
        -   *Then* each of these futures will have some non-zero present chance of
            coming about.

-   Let $F$ be some particular alternative future, and one that determine different
    present chances than the actual future does.
    -   $F$ will not come about, since it differs from the actual future.
    -   But! There is some present chance of $F$.
        -   That is, there is some present chance that event would go in such a way
            as to complete a chancemaking pattern that would make the present chances
            different from what they actually are.

    -   Present chances *undermine* themselves.

#### An example of undermining

-   For *instance*, there is a minute *present chance* that for more tritium atoms
    will exist in the future than have existed, and each one will decay in only a few
    minutes.
    -   If this unlikely future came to pass, it would complete a chancemaking
        pattern on which the half-life would be much less than the actual 12.26
        years.
        -   This is so under both *frequentism* and *best-system account of laws*.

    -   Could this come to pass?
        -   *Yes*, in the sense there's a non-zero present chance of it.
        -   *No*, in the sense that its coming to pass contradicts the truth about
            present chances.

    -   *If* it came to pass, *then* the truth about present chances would be different.
    -   It's not that the present changes, but rather it would never have been different.

-   This is "no worse than peculiar."

#### A closer look at the Principal Principle

-   The Principal Principle *does* rule out undermining!
    -   It was this that led Lewis to despair about the Humean analysis of laws.

-   Here's the **contradiction** the Principal Principle leads to. Take some
    particular time and:
    -   Let $C$ be the rational credence function for someone whose evidence is limited
        to the past and ppresent.
    -   Let $P$ be the function that gives the present chances of all propositions.
    -   Let $A$ be any proposition.
    -   Let $E$ be any proposition that satisfies two condition:
        1.  It specifies the present chance of $A$, in accordance with $P$.
        2.  It gives no "inadmissible" information about future history, that is,
            no information about how chance events in the present and future turn out.

    -   The Principal Principle is therefore:

        $$C(A|E) = P(A)$$

    -   Now take $A$ to be $F$, our alternative future history that would yield present
        chances different from the actual ones.
    -   And let $E$ be the whole truth about the present chances as they actually are.
    -   Recal that $F$ had some present chance of coming about.
    -   So, by the Principal Principle:
        
        $$C(F|E) \not = 0$$
        $$C(F|E)      = 0$$

### No refuge

-   It is because some of the pattern lies in the future that there is a possibility
    that the future could undermine present chances.
    -   Of course, it'd go away if we assume the pattern lay entirely in the past.

-   But we can't assume this, and here's why:

#### The Problem of the Early Moment

-   There might be a beginning of time, or a beginning of a certain kinds of
    chancy phenomena go on. 
    -   What could make the chances at a moment not long after the beginning?

#### The Problem of Fluctuation

-   We usually think that there are laws, and hence regularities, of uniform chances.
    -   "All tritium atoms have precisely the same chance of decaying in a given period."
    -   It is not to be expected that the different chancemaking patterns in these
        different segments will all make the same chance of decay.

#### The Problem of Drift

-   Take the two problems together, and you have the *problem of drift*.
    -   For simple frequentism:
        -   Suppose early on, $J$s divide 50-50 between $K$s and not-$K$s, but
            so far there haven't been many $J$s together.
        -   Then we should *expect* that there might be a chance to be a run of
            $K$s or not-$K$s, that would significantly raise or lower the chance
            of the next $J$ to be a $K$.
        -   Then the chance of being a $K$ would drift to one or zero, and remain
            there for a long time after.

#### unHumean

-   With all these problems, Lewis thinks his opponents will think he's done all the
    work for them.
    -   So he should just admit defeat.

-   But *there is no refuge here for the non-Humean*.
    -   Posit all the unHumean whatnots you like, so long as truths supervene on being.
    -   But *don't* call any allege features of reality "chance" unless you've already
        shown that you have something, knowledge of which would constrain rational
        credence.
        -   How could knowledge that two universal stand in a certain special relation
            $N*$ could constrain rational credence about the future co-instantiation
            of those universals?

-   Unless you *first* convince Lewis that it's a special chancemaking relation, where
    $J$ has a 50% chance of being $K$.
    -   But you can't just *say* that, you have to *show* that.

### The beginning of a solution

-   Our *problem* is, where $F$ is an *un-actualized future* that would *undermine* the
    *actual present chances* given by $E$, is that $C(F | E) = 0$ because $F$ and $E$
    are inconsistent, but $C(F|E) \not = 0$ by the Principal Principle because $E$
    specifies that $F$ has non-zero chance of coming about.
    -   If that use of the Principal Principle is fallacious, the contradiction goes
        away.

-   That use of the Principal Principle *is* fallacious, *if* the present chances are
    made by a pattern that extends into the future
    -   *Then* $E$ bears inadmissible information about future history.
    -   It excludes the future $F$.
    -   Since $E$ is inadmissible, the Principal Principle does not apply.
    -   The fatal move that led from Humeanism to contradiction is no better than
        such obvious blunders:

        $$C(\mathrm{coin \: falls \: heads} | \mathrm{it \: is \: fair \: and \: will fall \: heads \: 99/100}) = \frac{1}{2}$$

        or even

        $$C(\mathrm{the \: coin \: will \: fall \: heads} | \mathrm{it \: is \: fair \: and \: will \: fall \: heads}) = \frac{1}{2}$$

-   *Victory!*
    -   What we have just seen is that if chancemaking patterns extend into the future,
        then any use of the Principal Principle is fallacious.
    -   For any proposition that bears information about present chances thereby bears 
        information about future history.

-   According to the best-system analysis, information about present chances is
    inadmissible because it reveals future history.
    -   But this information is not inadmissible, as witness the way it figures
        figures in everyday reasoning about chance and reasoning.
        -   *Contradiction*.

### The solution completed

-   Admissibility admits of degree
    
    > A proposition $E$ may be imperfectly admissible because it reveals something or
    > or other about future history; and yet it may be very nearly admissible, because
    > it reveals so little as to make a negligible impact on rational credence.

-   Degrees of admissibility are a relative matter.

    > The imperfectly admissible $E$ may carry lots of inadmissible information that is
    > relevant to whether $B$, but very little that is relevant to whether $A$.

-   Near-admissibility may be good enough.

    > If $E$ specifies that the present chance of $A$ is $P(A)$, and if $E$ is nearly
    > admissible relative to $A$, then conclusion that $C(A | E) = P(A)$ will hold, if
    > not exactly, at least to a very good approximation.

### Correcting the Principal Principle

> We face a question. If the old Principal Principle applies only as an approximation,
> what is it an approximation to? How, exactly, is chance related to credence? Can we
> find a new, corrected Princpal Principle that works exactly when the old one works
> only approximately?

-   Here's a correction applicable only to a special case of the old Principal Principle.
    -   Let $H_{tw}$ be the proposition giving the complete history of world $w$ up to
        and including time $t$.
    -   Let $T_w$ be the complete theory of chance for world $w$.
        -   A proposition giving all the probabilistic laws and therefore all the true
            history-to-chance conditional that hold at $w$.

    -   Let $P_{tw}$ be the chance distribution at time $t$ and world $w$.
    -   If $T_w$ were admissible, then the conjunction $H_{tw}T_w$ would also be
        admissible.
        -   It would specify the chance at $t$ at $w$ of any proposition $A$.

    -   So we could put it for $E$ in the old Principal Principle.
    -   Dropping the subscripts, we have:

        > (OP) $C(A|HT) = P(A)$

        -   "The credence you should assign to $A$ given the complete history of
            the world and the complete theory of chance is equal to the probability
            of $A$"

    -   The correction Lewis favor is:

        > (NP) $C(A | HT) = P(A | T)$

        -   "The credence you should assign to $A$ given the complete history and
            complete theory of chance at a world is equal to the probability of
            $A$ given the complete theory of chance of the world."

    -   If $T$ were perfectly admissible, then (OP) would be correct derived as an
        instance of the old Principal Principle.

-   *If* there are undermining futures with non-zero present chance that make $T$ false,
    *then* $T$ rules out these undermining futures.
    -   If so, then:
        1.  $T$ and $HT$ are not perfectly admissible.
        2.  (OP) is not correctly derived.
        3.  (OP) cannot be applied to determine $C(A|HT)$
        4.  $P(T) \not = 1$
        5.  Exception cases aside, $P(A) \not = P(A|T)$.

    -  If so, then accept (NP).

-   Conditionalize on $T$ to avoid undermining futures.

### Against perfectionism

-   The new version of the Principal Principle is better by Humean lights, but
    the old one is *more intuitive*.
    -   So the old Principle is "key to our concept of chance."

> Chance can be defined as that feature of Reality that obeys the old Principle, yet
> chance doesn't quite obey it! Isn't this incoherent?

-   *No*.
    -   A feature of Reality deserves the name "chance" to the extent it 
        occupies the role of chance.
    -   Occupying the role means obeying the old Principle.
    -   But undermining means that nothing occupies the role perfectly, so nothing
        perfectly deserves the name.
    -   But near enough is good enough.
    -   And if nature is kind, the chances ascribed by the probabilistic laws of the
        best system will obey the old Principle to a very good approximation.
        -   Therefore, they will occupy the chance role enough to deserve the name.
        -   To deny this would by *silly*.

-   Some equivalent silliness:
    -   Nothing deserves the name "sensation" unless it were infallibly introspection.
    -   Nothing deserves the name "simultaneity" unless it were a frame-indepedant
        equivilence relation.
    -   Nothing deserves the name "value" unless it couldn't possible fail to attract
        anyone who is well acquainted with it.
