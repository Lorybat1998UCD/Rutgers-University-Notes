Theory of Knowledge <small>with Kurt Sylvan</small>
===================================================

Syllabus
--------

### Course Description

Epistemology is a major branch of philosophy dedicated to questions
about the nature and structure of knowledge, justified belief, evidence,
good inference, etc. Examples of central questions include:

-   What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge?
-   To gain knowledge from a reliable source, does one also need to know
    that the source is reliable?
-   Must all beliefs be justified by other beliefs, or are there some
    non-inferentially justified beliefs?
-   Are the factors that make for justified belief all internal, or are
    some external?
-   Is evidence necessary for justified belief? If so, is good evidence
    *all* one needs for justification?
-   Do we know anything? Can we answer the skeptic? (Must we answer the
    skeptic?)

We will read and argue about some classic answers to these questions
(and others) in the class.

### Readings

Many readings will come from Epistemology: An Anthology (eds. Sosa, Kim,
Fantl and McGrath). I also recommend (but don't require) reading from
Richard Fumerton's introductory book Epistemology. These books and
almost everything else that we will read are available on the Sakai site
for the class. A few background readings will also be drawn from the
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, which is [free
online](plato.standford.edu).

### Assignments, Grading and Policies

Your grade will be based on:

1.  *Discussion Board Comments/Questions*. You are responsible for
    posting
    (I) some questions about the reading or (II) some critical comments
        or objections to the arguments in the reading on the Discussion
        Board on Sakai. These can be anywhere from a few sentences to
        several pages what matters is that they help you learn the
        material. You should post these, at latest, at 9:00 on the night
        before the class meeting. Each of you should do this for 5
        meetings of your choosing. This is for 20% of the grade.

2.  *Attendance and Participation*. You must the class regularly to do
    well and avoid getting lost. I will allow one unexcused absence, and
    you will be penalized for every subsequent unexcused absence. You
    are also encouraged to participate by talking as much as possible.
    This will be for 10% of the grade.
3.  *Exam*. There will be a take-home mid-term exam. I'll hand out
    questions on 6/13 and you will have a week to write answers to them,
    and hand them into me in printed form on 6/20. This is for 30% of
    the grade.
4.  *Final Paper*. A final paper of 6-10 pages is due on 7/4 or earlier
    by email. I'll post topics on 6/13. You can also design your own
    topic, but you must pass it by me first. This is for 40% of the
    grade. Do not plagiarize on your papers! This is severely penalized
    by the University and easy to detect.

### Contact Information and Office Hours

You can contact me via ksylvan@philosophy.rutgers.edu. I will hold
office hours in Seminary 1, Room 012 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from
4:00-5:30. Feel free to arrange an appointment with me if you can't make
the office hours and have any questions or want to discuss your work.

### "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?" <small>Edmund Gettier</small>

-   What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge?
    -   Those attempts are of a form similar to:

    > (a) $S$ knows that $P$ iff
    >
    > 1.  $P$ is true.
    > 2.  $S$ believes that $P$, and
    > 3.  $S$ is justified in believing that $P$.

-   It is possible in being justified in believing something that is *in
    fact* false.
    -   For any proposition $P$ that $S$ is justified in believing,
        where $P$ entails $Q$ and $P$ accepts $Q$, then $S$ is justified
        in beliving $Q$.

#### Case I

> (d) Jones is the man who will get the job, and Jones has ten conns in
>     his pocket.
>
> (e) The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.
>
> -   Smith has strong evidence for (d).
> -   (d) entails (e).
>
-   Smith accepts (e) on the grounds of (d), which he is justified in
    doing.
-   But unknown to Smith, he, not Jones, will get the job.
-   He also happens to have 10 coins in his pocket.
    -   So (e) is true.
    -   Smith believes (e).
    -   Smith is justified in believing (e).

#### Case II

> (f) Jones owns a Ford.
>
> (g) Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Boston.
>
> (h) Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Barcelona.
>
> (i) Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Brest-Litovsk.
>
> -   Smith has strong evidence to believe that (f).
> -   Smith accepts (g), (h), and (i) *on the basis of* (f).
>     -   Smith is completely justified in doing so.
>
-   Imagine that Jones does *not* own a Ford, but is driving a rented
    car.
    -   And by coincidence, Brown happens to be in Barcelona, making (h)
        true.

-   Therefore,
    1.  (h) is true.

    2.  Smith does believe that (h) is true.
    3.  Smith is justified in believing that (h) is true.

#### Conclusion

-   (a) does not state *sufficient* conditions for knowledge.

### The Search for the Tether and the JTB Theory

#### Plato's Tether

Our question for the next several meetings:

> (Q) What distinguishes knowledge from a lucky guess (or a mere true
>     opinion)?

​(Q) goes back to the *Meno*, where Plato puts a metaphorical answer in
Socrates' mouth:

> SOCRATES: True opinions, for as long as they remain, are fine things
> and do nothing but good. But they don't hang around for long; they
> escape from a man's mind, so that they are not worth much until one
> tethers them with chains of reasons why. [...] That is why knowledge
> is prized more highly than correct opinion; knowledge differs from
> correct opinion in being tethered down.
>
> MENO: Yes, by Zeus, Socrates, it does seem to go something like that.

#### JTB

But what is this tether? Socrates suggests that it consists in a *chain
of reasons why*. A natural way to make this more precise is to think
that what distinguishes K from mere TB is *justification*: someone who
makes more than a lucky guess is *justified* in believing as she does.
Exactly what justification involves is a huge question. For the moment,
let's just use the intuitive idea, and consider this answer to (Q):

> **(JTB)** Justification is what distinguishes knowledge from a lucky
> guess.

In other words: knowledge $=$ justified true belief.

After this suggestion hit the philosophical newsstand, little changed
for the ensuing 2300+ years. Even in the first half of the 20th century,
JTB was accepted in some form or another. One can find versions, e.g.,
in Chisholm and Ayer:

> **(Ayer's view)** $S$ knows that $P$ iff (i) $S$ is sure that $P$,
> (ii) $S$ has the right to be sure that $P$, and (iii) $P$ is true.

<!-- -->

> **(Chisholm's view)** $S$ knows that $P$ iff (i) $S$ accepts $P$, (ii)
> $S$ has adequate evidence for $P$, and (iii) $P$ is true.

#### Elements of JTB

Before moving on, it's worth saying a bit about the elements of the JTB
theory, since it isn't wholly uncontroversial that each is really
necessary for knowledge:

-   **Belief**: It's plausible that one can't know some proposition
    without at least believing it. This is witnessed by the absurdity of
    sentences like: 'I know that it's raining but I am not sure that
    it's raining'. This simply sounds incoherent. Nonetheless, there are
    some cases where one can put pressure on the belief condition.
    Consider:

-   **Exam**: Albert is quizzed on English history. One question is:
    'When did Queen Elizabeth die?' Albert doesn't think he knows, but
    answers the question correctly, by writing that Elizabeth died in
    1603. Moreover, he gives correct answers to many other questions to
        which he didn't think he knew the answer.

    -   There's some temptation to say that Albert knows that Elizabeth
        died in 1603 but doesn't believe that she died in 1603.

    -   Still, we need to distinguish between implicit and explicit
        belief. Consider someone who has a prejudice against some group
        of people and is disposed to treat them as inferior. This person
        may explicitly deny that he has this prejudice, and not believe
        that he has it. Still, given his behavior, it seems appropriate
        to ascribe him as having the *implicit* belief that members of
        this group are inferior. Given the distinction between implicit
        and explicit belief, it is also plausible that Albert does at
        least *implicitly* believe that Elizabeth died in 1603.

-   **Truth**: Sometimes we say things like 'I just *knew* it was going
    to happen. But then it didn't!' These claims don't sound incoherent.
    But wouldn't they be incoherent if knowing that P entailed P? The
    epistemologist's response is to allow that the English word 'knows'
    might be used non-literally to express the speaker's *feeling* of
    knowing.
    -   Still, once we are engaged in philosophical elucidation, it is
        more helpful to distinguish between the mere feeling of knowing
        and actual knowing (assuming there is *some* actual knowing,
        *pace* radical skeptics). Perhaps the *word* can express both.
        But as long as we can *conceptually* distinguish the two we can
        simply recognize that the JTB theory isn't about the feeling of
        knowing but about actual knowing.

-   **Justification**: A large can of worms. We'll see that some major
    epistemologists have denied that justification is really necessary
    for knowledge. One can get the feeling for this by simply thinking
    again about exam. If Albert does know that Elizabeth died in 1603,
    what *justification* could he possibly have for believing that she
    died in 1603? It sure seems that he doesn't have *evidence* for
    believing this.
    -   The main response to this challenge is to insist that being
        justified in believing something needn't consist in having
        evidence for believing something, though evidence is *one* way
        to get justified. Perhaps, for example, reliable sources like
        memory and intuition, etc., can yield justified beliefs that
        don't require independent evidence.

### Gettier: JTB ≠ K

Gettier's little paper presents two simple counterexamples to JTB. As
we'll be seeing, there are heaps of similar cases that pop up to
undermine revisions of JTB (i.e., 'JTB+' views).

> **(Case I)** Smith has strong evidence for the following proposition:
>
> (P) Jones will get the job and has ten coins in his pocket.
>
> This entails:
>
> (Q) Someone who has ten coins in his pocket will get the job. By
>     coincidence, Smith rather than Jones will get the job. Smith also
>     has ten coins in his pocket, though he doesn't realize it. So, (Q)
>     is true and Smith is justified in believing (Q).

But Smith does not know (Q).

> **(Case II)** Smith has strong evidence for the following proposition:
>
> (R) Jones owns a Ford.
>
> This entails
>
> (S) Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Boston.
>
> Smith deductively infers (S) from (R), and so justifiedly believes
> (S). By chance, Brown is in Boston, and (S) is true only for this
> reason.

But Smith does not know (S).

There are more intuitive cases that one could give that have this
structure. Consider:

> **(Sheep in the Field)** Smith goes for a drive in the country. He
> looks off into a field and sees what looks exactly like a sheep. So he
> justifiably believes:
>
> That animal in the field is a sheep.
>
> Smith's son is in the back seat reading a book and not looking at the
> scenery. He asks if there are any sheep in the field they are passing.
> Smith says 'Yes', adding:
>
> There is a sheep in the field.
>
> Smith is justified by what he sees in believing (1). (2) follows from
> (1), so he is justified in believing (2). As it turns out, (1) is
> false: what Smith sees is a sheep dog. But (2) is true anyway: there's
> a real sheep just behind the sheep dog which Smith can't see.

### A Cheap Response: No False Grounds

Gettier gives us the recipe he used for generating these particular
cases in the paper. Cases I and II are simply cases where (i) one is
justified in believing something false but (ii) infers something true
from it using a good method. The inferred true belief will be justified
given:

> **(Deductive J-Closure)** For any proposition P, if S is justified in
> believing P, P entails Q, and S deduces Q from P and accepts Q as a
> result of this deduction, then S is justified in believing Q.

Seeing this, some people in the early literature thought it was easy to
revise JTB to avoid Gettier's problem. They suggested:

> **(JTB+No False Grounds)** S knows that P iff (i) S believes that P,
> (ii) P is true, (iii) S is justified in believing P, and (iv) all of
> S's grounds for believing P are true.

But this proposal faces two problems: it is too weak and too strong.
First, it is easy to construct cases where the subject doesn't reason
from any false premises. Consider:

> Henry drives into a part of the state that he's never visited before.
> He is looking at a real barn, and has impeccable visual and other
> evidence that it is a barn. His justification is sound in every way.
> However, in the rest of this unusual part of the state there only
> fake, papiere-mache barns, any of which would have fooled Henry into
> thinking it was a barn.

Here, Henry doesn't engage in any inference at all: he just looks at the
barn and believes that there's a barn there. He does not reason from
anything false. Still, he doesn't know. For it is just by sheer luck
that he finds himself in front of the one real barn in the area.

Another reason why JTB+No False Grounds fails is that it's too strong.
We *can* sometimes know things even though some of our grounds for
belief are false. Consider:

> Smith has two independent sets of reasons for thinking that someone in
> his office owns a Ford. One set of reasons has to do with the wily
> Nogot, who says that he owns a Ford, drives around a Ford (which isn't
> really his, unbeknownst to Smith), etc. But Smith has equally strong
> reasons having to do with Havit. And Havit does own a Ford.

In this kind of case, Smith might reason to the true conclusion that
someone in his office owns a Ford from the whole set of reasons, some of
which are false. Intuitively, Smith can still know that someone in his
office owns a Ford even though *some* of these reasons are false. But
JTB+No False Grounds predicts otherwise. So JTB+No False Grounds fails.

### Epistemic Luck

If one wants to solve the Gettier problem while holding onto a broadly
JTB+ theory, the strategy will be to (i) find an element that all
Gettier cases have in common and (ii) add to JTB a clause that says that
this element must be absent. We've seen one unpromising way to do
thisthe 'no false grounds' view. But in seeing why this view failed, we
got a hint of a more abstract feature that these cases share. Remember
what we said about Henry in fake barn country: 'It is *just by sheer
luck* that he finds himself in front of the one real barn in the area'.

This does seem to be an important feature of the cases we've seen so
far. In all of them, the person lands on a true belief only by luck. It
was a sheer coincidence in Case I that Smith himself also had 10 coins
in his pocket. It was a sheer coincidence in Case II that Smith happened
to infer a disjunction whose second disjunct (i.e., that Brown is in
Boston) was true. He could so easily have inferred a different
disjunction whose second disjunct was false. It was a sheer coincidence
in Sheep in the Field that there was a real sheep hiding behind the
sheepdog. Etc.

This isn't to say that these people engaged in *lucky guessing*. They
were justified in believing what they believed. So, there's a different
kind of luck that arises in Gettier cases.

Now, we can't just say that *no* kind of luckily true belief is
compatible with knowledge. Consider some other examples where knowledge
isn't missing.

-   It's in some sense a matter of luck that I'm in this room. The last
    five years could so easily have been different, if slight changes
    were made to the years before them. But that doesn't mean that I
    don't know that there are students in this room.

-   Furthermore, if I look out the window and happen to see something
    really rare and bizarre, it hardly follows that I can't know that
    this rare and bizarre thing is happening. Still, there's a sense in
    which the beliefs I form are true by luck.

-   Another example from Ichikawa and Steup: 'Suppose that someone
    enters a raffle and wins an encyclopedia, then reads various of its
    entries, correcting many of his previous misapprehensions. There is
    a sense in which the resultant beliefs are true only by luckfor our
    subject was very lucky to have won that rafflebut this is not the
    sort of luck, intuitively, that interferes with the possession of
    knowledge.'

So, how should we understand the luck that matters? This question is as
hard to answer as the Gettier problem is to solve. So we can't solve the
Gettier problem with a theory like:

-   **(JTB+No Luck)** S knows that P iff (i) S believes that P, (ii) P
    is true, (iii) S is justified in believing P, and (iv) S doesn't
    believe truly merely by luck.

This simply provides a new label for the problem without solving it.

Still, it does point us in a helpful direction. If we could provide an
analysis of the *relevant* notion of a belief's being true merely by
luck, we might stand a chance of solving the Gettier problem. So we've
made some progress: we've ruled out one unhelpful approach and have
gotten a grip on a strategy that will guide us. In future meetings,
we'll see some proposals that might help us to understand the nature of
epistemic luck.

### Gettier

-   Some people try to make a strong connection between knowledge and
    justification.
    -   Since Gettier, people have dropped this for "JTB+ view"

-   The story is that Gettier was up for tenure review, and his
    publication history wasn't great.
    -   So he quickly cooked up this paper "Is Justified True Belief
        Knowledge?"

-   The article consists of 2 counterexamples about the belief that
    knowledge contains justified true beliefs (JTB).

### Epistemic Luck

-   There are some scientific theories that assume things that just
    cannot be true.
    -   Like Newton's theory of gravitation, not as good as relativity.
    -   You can come to know true things from false premises.

### Selections from *Thought* in *E:AA* <small>by Gilbert Harman</small>

#### Knowledge and Probability

##### The lottery paradox

-   Some people think we never believe anything for which we are not
    certain.
    -   We have higher and lower "subjective probability."
    -   If knowledge implies belief, we never know anything that isn't
        absolutely certain.
    -   This conflicts with intuitions about knowledge, where we think
        we know some things with a greater probability than we think we
        know others.

-   We might count as belief anything whose "subjective probability"
    exceeds $.99$.
    -   This would also conflict with ordinary views.
    -   We do not suppose that a man inconsistently believes of every
        participant in a fair lottery that the participant will lose.
        -   Even if we suppose that the man assigns a subjective
            probability greater than $.99$ to each's person's losing.

    -   If ordinary views are to be preserved, belief must be
        distinguish from high degree of belief.

-   A rule of inductive inference is sometimes called a "rule of
    acceptance"
    -   It tells us what we can accept given other beliefs and degrees
        of belief.
    -   A purely probability rule of acceptance says that we may accept
        something if and only if its probability is greater than $.99$.
    -   Kyburg points out that such rule leads to the "lottery paradox"
        because it authorizes an inconsistent set of beliefs.

-   It is paradoxical to suppose that we could rationally believe of
    every participant in a lottery that he will lose.

##### Gettier examples and probabilistic rules of acceptance

> (P) Reasoning that essentially involves false conclusions,
>     intermediate or final, cannot give one knowledge.

-   Probabilistic rules of acceptance do not permit an explanation of
    Gettier examples by means of (P).
-   A defender of purely probabilist rules might reply that in a Gettier
    case, the believer of the false "knowledge" must infer her
    conclusion not that she must conclude not from the belief but from
    the evidence.
    -   But given any evidence, some false conclusion will be highly
        probable.
    -   For example, let (s) be a conclusion saying under what
        conditionals the NJ State Lottery was most recently held.
        -   Let (q) say what ticket won the grand prize.
        -   Consider the conclusion "not both (s) and (q)" and call this
            (r).
        -   The conclusions (r) is highly probable, but (r) is false.
        -   If such highly probable false conclusions were always
            considered essential to an inference, the Gettier believer
            could never come to know anything.

-   The problem is purely probabilistic considerations do not suffice to
    account for the peculiar relevance about the ownership of the car.
-   The trouble is that purely probabilistic rules are incompatible with
    the natural account of Gettier examples by means of principle (P).
    -   The solution is not to modify (P) but modify inference.

#### Knowledge and Explanation

##### A causal theory

-   Goldman suggests we know only if there is the *proper sort* of
    causal connection between our belief and what we know.
    -   For example, perceiving something and believing that something
        is there is somehow properly causally protected.

-   The Gettier believer fails because the causal connection is lacking.
-   General knowledge does not fit into this simple framework.
    -   All emeralds being green is neither caused nor caused by the
        particular green emeralds we come to know.

-   Perhaps a person knows by inference only if all conclusions
    essential to that inference are true.
    -   The inference must satisfy (P).
    -   Mary fails to know because she is wrong when she infers that
        Nogot's past ownership is responsible for Nogot's present
        ownership.

##### Inference to the best explanatory statement

-   It gets better is we replace "cause" with "because."
-   This account better explains ordinary usage.
    -   Nogots past ownership explains Mary's evidence, but it is odd to
        think it is caused by Mary's evidence.
    -   The detective infers that activities of the butler explain these
        footprints, does he infer these activities caused these
        footprints?

-   Moving from "cause" to "because" avoids Goldman's *ad hoc* treatment
    of knowledge.
-   "X's tend to be Y's will explain the next X will be Y" is
    sufficiently more plausible that competitors such as "interfering
    factor Q will prevent the next X from being a Y."
    -   The doctor says you will get measles.
    -   Because doctors are normally right, it will explain why the
        doctor is right in this case.

##### Further examples

-   There is a box of Sure-Fire matches.
    -   I infer that the next match will late on the premise that all
        the others have lit.
    -   It turns out the next match is a defective match, that needs to
        be raised to 600 degree to light.
    -   I strike the match and a sudden blast of Q-radiation to 600
        degrees, and the match lights. Did I know it would light? *No.*

##### Statistical inference

-   You walk into a casino and see the roulette wheel stop at red fifty
    times in a row.
    -   The explanation may be that the wheel is fixed.
        -   It could be that the wheel is fair and this is one of those
            times when fifty reds comes up in a fair wheel.

    -   But if the explanation is that the wheel is fair and that this
        is just one of the times, it says what the sequence of red is
        the result of, the "outcome of."
        -   It does *not* say why fifty red occurred this time rather
            than another time.

##### Conclusion

-   We are led to construe induction as inference to the best
    explanation.
    -   Inductive reasoning is seen to consist in a sequence of
        explanatory conclusions.

-   We are led here because Gettier cases need to be accounted for.
-   The present model replaces Goldman's "causal" with "explanatory."

#### Evidence One Does Not Possess

##### Evidence against what one knows

> One knows if there is no evidence such that if one knew about the
> evidence one would be justified in believing one's conclusions.

### "A Causal Theory of Knowing" <small>by Alvin Goldman</small>

-   Begins with Gettier.

    > (q) Jones owns a Ford.
    >
    > (r) Either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona. ("Or-in")
    >
-   One hypothesis for solving this is to say that Smith cannot be said
    to know this because it's false, and so he can't justify something
    from it.
    -   What Goldman will do is take this specific case, analyze it, and
        generalize to a new take on "S knows that p."

-   What makes (p) true is the fact that Brown is in Barcelona, but that
    has nothing to with Smith's believing that (p).
    -   Alternatively, if Jones owned a Ford, and his owning a Ford
        manifested by his offer of a ride to Smith, and he offered Smith
        a ride, we'd say that Smith knew Ford.
    -   The requirement of such a **causal connection** is what Goldman
        wants to add.

-   One of the good examples of an appropriate causal connection is that
    of perception (specifically the one defended by H. P. Grice)
    -   Where (S) sees that there is a vase in front of him.
        -   A necessary condition of (S)'s seeing that there is a vase
            is that there be a certain kind of causal connection between
            the presence of the vase and (S)'s believing that a vase is
            present.

    -   Largely, this is a "problem" for special science and not
        philosophy.

-   Goldman comes up with veritable *and* deviant causal chains.
    -   There, evidently, needs to be a "special sort," where the
        presence of the vase is connected with (S)'s belief.

-   What of the scope of perceptual knowledge?
    -   I can know of the vase.
    -   Can I know a painting is from Picasso?
    -   "Left indeterminate."

-   Now consider memory.
    -   A causal connection between earlier belief of (p) and later
        belief of (p) is certainly a necessary ingredient in memory.
        -   This is the same as his last argument, maintained over $t_0$
            to $t_1$.

-   He can connect perception and memory, but more interestingly,
    Goldman moves to *inference*.
-   Infernece is to say that (S) knows that (P) and does not entail an
    explicit, consicious process of reasoning.
-   Suppose (S) perceives that there is solidified lava in the
    countryside.
    -   Where (p) and (q) are the propositions,

            (p) ---> (q) ---> B_s(q)\
                                     \
                                      \
                            B_s(r) ---> B_s(p)

-   (S) can come to know (p) when he correctly reconstrucs the causal
        chain leading from (p) to the evidence for (p) that (S)
        perceives.

    -   What's illusory about this, I think, is "correctly." I think
        this is just a "step up" from saying that (S) is justified in
        (p).

-   "Appropriate" knowledge producing causal processes include:
    1.  Perception
    2.  Memory
    3.  A causal chain, pattern 1 or 2, correctly reconstructed by
        inferences.
    4.  Combinations of (1), (2), and (3).

-   Meta-analysis of knowledge is *not* causal.

May 30th, 2013 <small>Lecture</small>
-------------------------------------

-   We looked at the original Gettier in the last class and saw how JTB
    is not knowledge.
    -   Perhaps no false assumptions?
    -   Today we'll see a more sophisticated version of this.

### Defeasibility Theories and Objective Defeaters

-   Before Harman, there is another tradition that Harman criticizes.
    -   The theory was the "defeasibility theory."

-   On one hand, we talk about evidence in an objective sense, and we
    search for facts.
    -   There's **objective evidence**, evidence which is "out there,"
        but they are facts that we do not have access to.
    -   Then **possessed evidence**, which is what we actually have.

-   With this there are two kinds of normative statuses:
    -   A **correct belief** is one that is supported by all objective
        evidence that exists.
    -   An **epistemically rational** belief is one supported by the
        evidence we have.

-   There are two types of defeaters, for two kinds of defeat:
    -   A **rebutting defeater** is a counter-example, or evidence to
        suggest the opposition.
    -   A **undercutting defeater** undermines your evidence, like
        learning that your source was faulty. It says nothing about the
        fact of the matter.

-   All of people had a stipulative definition of an objective defeater
    that does not lead to a "true/undefeated" proposition.
    -   The stated objections rely on the definition.

-   Objective defeaters are the evidence you do not have in a Gettier
    case.

### Harman's Theory

-   He provides a more sophisticated version, the reasons why it's more
    sophisticated:
    -   He adds the condition that it has to be the case that you don't
        essentially rely on any false ground.
        -   If you know you must have no false grounds, which predicts
            the wrong things.

    -   Widen the notion of inferences, and allow for them to all be
        knowledge, there are these cases that look like non-inferential
        cases.
        -   In the fake barns case, you're relying on the assumption
            that conditions are normal, that appearance reliably
            correspondends to reality.

### Goldman's Theory

-   According to Goldman, what's going on in Gettier cases is causal.
    -   The holding a belief and the facts are not casually related, and
        that's what's wrong.

-   You have knowledge if and only if you have there is an appropriate
    causal relationship between the justification and the
    truth/knowledge.
    -   Where is the "appropriateness."

-   There are "deviant causal chains" where things are wholly related to
    the facts in an intuitively non-perceptual, false-memory, etc, way.

### "Knowledge and Skepticism" <small>Robert Nozick</small>

#### Knowledge

-   Our task is to formulate further conditions to go alongside:

> 1.  $p$ is true.
> 2.  $S$ believes that $p$.

-   We want:
    -   Each condition to be necessary.
    -   Jointly sufficient for knowlege.

-   The causal condition on knowledge is inhospitiable to mathematical
    and ethical knowledge.
-   Consider the third condition (two formulations):

> 3.  If $p$ weren't true, $S$ woudn't believe that $p$.
> 4.  $\lnot p \to \lnot B(S, p)$

June 4th, 2013 <small>Lecture</small>
-------------------------------------

-   Now we're going to talk about theories that hold that it's just an
    accident that people form JTBs.
-   It's reasonable if you think about someone infering from Jones
    owning a Ford to something false, and then you notice that while
    it's justified, it is an accident.
    -   People want to give an account of the accident.
    -   Non-accidentality

### The Tether in Modal Terms

-   When philosophers talk about modality, they are talking about
    statements like "could", "would" "must."
-   The counterfactual or subjenctive conditional statement is of the
    form:

> If it were true that $A$, it would be true that $C$.

-   Philosophers have used "nearby possible worlds" as a concept
    recently.

> In similar possible circumstances when $A$, then $C$ is also true.

<!-- -->

> **(Sensitivity)** $S$ knows that $P$ only if if $P$ were false, $S$
> would not believe that $P$.
>
> **(Safety)** $S$ knows that $P$ only if $S$ would believe $P$ only if
> $P$ were true.

-   These are distinct logical conditions
-   Order in questions:
    -   First order questions are like "does $P$ know that $S$?" $$Kp$$

    -   Second order questions are "does $P$ know that $P$ knows $S$?"
        $$KKp$$

-   A good analogy is like thermometers: A thermometer that says 70
    degrees but is broken is not right when it is actually 70 degrees.

### Nozick and Sensitivity

-   Nozick notices that there is a counterexample which he calls the
    (Grandma) case.
    -   When her grandson is doing well, she observes that he is doing
        well.
    -   When he is not doing well, the family make her believe he is.

-   The way that he accounts for this counterexample is by saying you
    must always have the same method for coming to know something in
    both cases.
-   Relativizing to methods is a richer and more accurate way of
    thinking about it because you want to keep some variables constant.
-   I do not think that in lottery cases you can assert that your ticket
    will lose because you are presented with a precision of facts do not
    exist in other belief cases. *Knowledge and Lotteries*, book, read.

-   Virtues:
    1.  Explains many Gettier cases.
    2.  Explains you can "never know" if your ticket is a loser.
    3.  Explains skeptics worries and yields the right response.

> **(The argument from ignorance)**:
>
> 1.  You know that: if you have hands, then you're not a brain in a
>     vat.
> 2.  (Closure) If you know that $P$ and know that if $P$, then $Q$,
>     then you know that $Q$.
> 3.  But you don't know that you're not a brain in a vat.
> 4.  So, *you don't know that you're not a brain in a vat.*

    1.  (Closure) is right, making you wrong.

### *Apt Belief and Reflective Knowledge* <small>Chapters 2 and 5, by Ernie Sosa</small>

#### Lecture 2 <small>A Virtue Empistemology</small>

-   When an archer takes aim and shoots, that shot is assessable in
    three respects:
    1.  Whether he succeeds in its aim, hitting the target.
    2.  Whether it is adroit, manifests the skills of the archer.
    3.  Whether it is apt, whether it is because he is accurate and
        adroit.

### "Virtue Epistemology" <small>by Greco, J. and Turri, J.</small>

### Analysis of Knowledge <small>[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/)</small>

June 6th, 2013 <small>Lecture</small>
-------------------------------------

### Nozick and sensitivity

-   Nozick came up with the sensitivity argument.
-   He noticed that it entailed it that closure is false.
-   Being clever, he also realized he could use it to respond to the
    skeptic.
    -   This meant that it was a virtue and not a vice.

-   If you wanted to motivate sensitivity on it's own, there's a lot you
    can do.
    -   Very often, we want sensitivity.
    -   If your beliefs were false and you'd still hold them, that'd be
        a problem.

### Safety

-   We can imagine easily a world where a common scenario is found in a
    dream, making you wrong, a wrong belief.
    -   So dreams *have to be* fake.

-   Well you wake up a realize it was a wrong belief.
    -   The person in fake barn country could learn more about their
        enviroment, and realize that they weren't looking at a barn or
        that they weren't allowed to use their assumption about the barn

-   "Retrospective knowledge" is dangerous.
-   Is this similar to the defeater problem?
    -   The simpler thing to say is that we can still evaluate the prior
        time slice, while they later went on to reform their beliefs, in
        the moment they didn't know.

#### An aside <small>Helpful Wishful Thinking</small>

-   There are some cases where a worry similar to circular reasoning
    arising.
-   Safety was proposed as a necessary condition on knowledge.
    -   What do you have to add to JTB to get knowledge?
    -   If you pursue safety for this, you get to avoid the helpful
        wishful thinking.

### Truth fairy

-   Devastating for necessary truth.
-   There is something behind the circular reasoning thought.

### Virtue epistemology

-   The more general pattern of evaluation is the AAA pattern.
-   On an analogy about archers,
    -   If it hit the bull's-eye, it is **accurate**.
    -   If it manifest the archer's competence, it is **adroit**.
    -   If the success of a shot was a manifestation of the archer's
        competence, it is **apt**.

-   The nice thing about Sosa's picture is that it allows us to
    understand Gettier cases as a specific instance of a failure of
    aptness.

### First order and second order seperation motivation

-   We don't need a criterion of truth to act.
    -   Does this mean you can act on belief?

-   From an abstract point of view, it is better to act on knowledge
    rather than abstract belief.

### Sosa and Analysis of knowledge

-   Sheep in a field
    -   The accurary of the belief is not determined by your aptness.
    -   There is not apt belief.

-   You've bought a box of surefire matches.
    -   There's only one which doesn't reliably light.
    -   But when you strike it, a peice of Q-radiation lights it.

### Animal knowledge and reflective knowledge

-   **Animal knowledge** is knowledge of primitive things, first order.
    -   It is *apt belief*.

-   **Reflective knowledge** is "apt belief aptly noted." $$RKp = KKp$$

### Is there Immediate Justification? <small>by James Pryor</small>

#### Justification

-   Can justification ever happen "immediately" or "non-inferentially"?
-   There could be some mix up about what is an isn't justification with
    the author.
-   You have *justification to believe $P$* if and only if you are in a
    position where $P$ is epistemically likely for you to be true.
    -   A very inclusive epistemic status.

-   All it means for Pryor is that it is appropriate for you to believe
    it.
-   If there is some state or condition you are in *in virtue of which*
    you have justification to believe $P$, Pryor will call is
    "justification making condition."
-   It will be useful for us to distinguish between having justification
    to believe and appropriately holding a belief.
    -   To have justification, it is not important whether you actually
        believe.
        -   There just have to be things that make believing an
            appropriate attitude.

    -   Appropriate belief requires more, you need to believe it, you
        need to have justification, and you need to believe on the right
        grounds.
        -   You need to believe it for the reasons that make you have
            justification to believe it.

#### Immediate Justification

-   There are some propositions that are believed because of other prior
    justification epistemically supporting them.
    -   Like with gas and gauges.
    -   When justification to believe does not comes from justification
        to believe other propositions, this justification is
        **immediate**.

-   Some clarifications:
    1.  The question of whether justificaiton to believe is mediate or
        immediate is a question of what kind of epistemic support you
        have.
        -   It is not a question of how much support you have.
        -   It is not about what physiological process you've undergone.
        -   Support for believe can be inferential even if you did not
            arrive at a proposition by deriving or infering from other
            beliefs.

    2.  In order for you have to have immediate justification, it is
        required that your justification comes from nowhere.
    3.  The fact you have immediate justification to belief something
        does not ential that no other beliefs are required to form or
        entertain that belief.
    4.  Justification is usually defeasible.
    5.  Beliefs epistemically overdetermined.

#### Why Believe in Immediate Justification?

-   The most famous argument for immediate justification is the
    **Regress Argument**.
    -   There is dialectical regrees.
    -   There is grounding regress.
    -   There is justification-making regress.
        -   This is what we will focus on.

-   The argument is that there are four ways for the regress to play
    out:
    1.  The regress never ends, and justification chains go on
        endlessly. (Infinite regression.)
    2.  What makes you justified in believing $P$ is having
        justification to believe other things, and what makes you
        believe some of those is your justification to believe $P$.
        (Closed loop.)
    3.  Eventually we get a proposition believed inappropriately.
        (Skepticism.)
    4.  Eventually we get a proposition you have justification to
        believe, but that justification does not come from your
        believing, or having justification to believe, any further
        propositions. (Immediate justification, knowledge, etc..)

-   Foundationalists argue that (1) and (2) are untenable.
    -   We must accept (3) or (4).

> her kitchen. Or at least, I believe it is. And it seems I could be

--------------------------------------

### Highlights from Last Time <small>Handout</small>

#### The AAA Scheme

-   Recall the archer, aiming, taking a shot.
    -   Was it accurate?
    -   Was the archer skilled?
    -   If the archer hit the bull's-eye, or was it something else?

-   Cases:
    1.  Accuracy with no skill.
        -   No competence
        -   Right by luck
        -   True belief without justification

    2.  Archer uses her skill but there is a wind.
        -   Competence, used the skill
        -   Didn't succeed.
        -   Justified false belief

    3.  Hit's the bull's-eye and uses some skill, but the explanation is
        not because of the bull's eye.
        -   Someone takes a shot at a target.
        -   Gust of wind swipes it away.
        -   Gust of wind swipes it back.
        -   It was only the second gust of wind, not manifestation of
            skill because of bull's-eye.
        -   These are Gettier cases.
        -   Form a true belief and you are justified, but it is not
            because of your competence.

#### Virtue epistemology, Sosa-style

-   Safety is bad
    -   The archer walks to the shooting range,
    -   All targets but one are covered by a force-field but one.
    -   The archer finds the one without it to try and hit it.
    -   The reason why their hitting is their competence.
    -   So easily could they have hit the other ones.
    -   In some cases of Gettier cases, like the fake barns, is like the
        force-fields.
    -   The person does know that they are looking at barn, but so
        easily could they of had another belief they have an inaccurate
        meta-belief.
    -   Even if they are getting right, it is not explained by this
        higher order competence.

### The Pyrrhonian Problem

-   An extreme version of skepticism.
-   Self-debasing, because the belief shows the belief was incorrectly
    held.
-   But the way philosophy works now is you have to write an article.
-   If you reject it, why is it that it doesn't work?
-   The response is **foundationalism**.
    1.  Some stopping isn't arbitray. Some beliefs are non-inferentially
        justified or basic.
        -   The authority of experience, they don't need to be justified
            themselves to justify beliefs.
        -   We're not going to worry about arbitrariness because it
            would be "senseless" to try and justify experiences.
        -   Current experiences that you're having right now.
        -   What is *your* justification for believing this.
        -   For now thought, we stay here, with the first question.

### Infinitism

-   The structure of justification can be infinite and non-repeating.
-   It avoids skepticism because being justified in believing implies
    that there is an infinite, non-repeating justification for belief.

### Foundationalism

-   There is a broad literature on how something can be non-inferential
    justification. Ways:
    -   Infallibility: Belief is non-inferentially justified only if
        believe implies truth.
        -   The *cogito*
        -   All necessary truths (unlikely)

    -   Indubitability: Belief that is non-inferentially justified only
        if the belief cannot be doubted.
        -   When psychological, when from the agent, they can doubt
            their own or a crazy person can doubt all.

#### Problems for Acquitance Foundatinalism

-   A big problem for acquitance foundationalism is the speckeled hen.
-   Fumerton believes that you must think that you have *a priori*
    probabilistic account of justification, or **skepticism**!?

#### Pryor's modest view

-   Does not commit you to:
    1.  It isn't infallible justification.
    2.  It isn't indefeasible justification.
    3.  It isn't what he calls "autonomous" justification.

### Coherentism

> There's no ultimate anchor for justification of belief, beliefs get
> individual justification by being in a system that is coherent.

-   There are different reasons for rejecting them:

#### Input

-   Coherentism fails because it cannot account for the rational
    constraints by experience.
-   Some set of beliefs could be perfectly coherent while exhibiting
    gross negligence with regards to reality.

#### Isolation and Alternative systems

-   Accordsing to the isolation objection, there is no reason to believe
    that sheer coherence as such is truth conducive.
-   You could have an infinite number of equally coherent systems which
    come up with different results about truth.

#### Virtuous Inconsistency

1.  It is realistic to suppose that:
    1.  I've formed some false belief.
    2.  Some of them are false. You can't know which, and so cannot be
        rationally required to abandon any right.

2.  This hols even for inquirers who are totally scrupulous.
3.  If so, it is clear that all my beliefs could be justified while I am
    also justified in believing something.
4.  But that statement is is incosisntent with the conjuction of all my
    beliefs.
5.  So it can be *more rational* to become *less coherent*.

> Incosistency can be rational, but truth is not consistent.

### Mentalism

-   Doxastic attitudes:
    1.  Belief
    2.  Disbelief
    3.  Suspension of judgement

-   There are two categories:
    1.  Doxastic mentalism
        -   Replaces "mental states" with "doxastic attitudes"
        -   Coherentists

    2.  Non-Doxastic Mentalism

June 18th, 2013 <small>Lecture</small>
--------------------------------------

-   We can imagine world in which wishful thinking is reliable, but we
    are still included to think that beliefs just by wishful thinking in
    those worlds are unjustified.
-   Another problem for reliablism is when a subject has a reliable
    method of justification that they don't know is justified.
-   Your belief could be hooked up to the world in the right way.
-   [Blindsighters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight) are a
    phenomenon where people who *cannot see* still *reliably* "guess"
    correctly when they are forced to "see" something, or asked.

### The Generality Problem

-   What type of process was being used?
    -   Reliabalism needs to give us a consistent response to "was he
        justified?"

-   Depending of which type of process we choose as the relevant one to
    test for reliability, process reliablism yields different answers as
    to whether the belief is justified. Examples:
    -   The process of forming a belief from perception.
    -   The process of forming a beliefs about creatures on the basis of
        visual perception in bad lighting conditions.
    -   The process of forming a belief that there

-   It's a problem because there are many true types of reliable
    processes which are not always true.

### Problem of Logical/Probabilistic Relations

-   The next problem is the problem of logical relations
    -   If you use a totally invalid inference, you can't come to know.
    -   Whether you infer correctly is related to whether you are
        justified.
    -   Logical and probelistics relations are *not* mental states, but
        if weak internalism says only mental states are important, it
        cannot explain why logical relations.

Answer prompt (1) and three other prompts of your choosing. Each answer
should be one page long at minimum (double-spaced). You do not get
significant extra credit just for writing a lot more than one page each.
What matters is that your answer is complete, accurate, and adroit. When
you give counterexamples, please indent them in their entirety and give
them names. Type your answers up and print them.

### Prompts

1.  Explain what the Gettier problem is and what kind of analysis of
    knowledge it refutes. Invent two Gettier cases of your own in
    explaining the problem, one of which is explained by the "No False
    Grounds" (NFG) view, and one of which is not obviously explained by
    that view. Then, explain how Gilbert Harman would try to address
    your second case with his more sophisticated NFG view. Having done
    so, evaluate Harman's view, explaining why you think it fails or
    could succeed.
2.  Explain how defeasibility theorists tried to solve the Gettier
    problem, with details about (a) how these theorists typically
    defined objective defeaters, and (b) why there are objective
    defeaters in Gettier cases given that definition. Explain why the
    usual definition of an objective defeater invites the objection from
    "defeater-defeaters". In doing so, give an example of your own where
    there is both (i) an unpossessed defeater and (ii) an unpossessed
    defeater-defeater given the typical definition. Explain why the
    defeasibility theory would *wrongly* predict that the subject does
    *not* know. Finally, explain whether you think the defeasibility
    theorist could avoid this objection.
3.  Explain Goldman (1967)'s causal theory of knowing. In doing so,
    explain how and why Goldman's theory is not as simple as the
    following theory:

    > (Too Simple) S knows that P iff S's belief that P is caused by the
    > fact that P.

    Having explained Goldman's theory, offer three objections to it. If
    your objections involve counterexamples, invent at least one new
    counterexample. Finally, consider and refute a possible response on
    Goldman's behalf to one of your objections.
4.  Explain Nozick's idea that a belief must "track the truth" to
    constitute knowledge, with a focus on what we called the sensitivity
    condition. In doing so, try to explain why Nozick's theory is
    initially appealing and intuitive. Explain how and why Nozick
    introduces the idea of a method of belief-formation in articulating
    his final account. What counterexample is he trying to avoid? Is the
    appeal to methods totally ad hoc, or is there a good independent
    reason for it? Finally, give two objections to the sensitivity
    condition. If you give counterexamples, invent one new
    counterexample.
5.  Explain Sosa (1999)'s idea that a belief must be "safe" to
    constitute knowledge. Why is Sosa's safety condition not equivalent
    to Nozick's sensitivity condition? List some advantages that safety
    has over sensitivity. Why is the distinction between safety and
    sensitivity tied in with a discussion of skepticism? How does Sosa
    try to explain away the appeal of the skeptic's premise that you
    can't know you are not a handless brain in a vat? End with one
    objection to safety as a necessary condition for knowledge.
6.  Explain Sosa (2007)'s "triple-A" evaluation scheme, using examples
    of a kind of performance other than archery. Then explain how the
    differences between
    1.  animal knowledge,
    2.  merely justified true belief,
    3.  justified false belief, and
    4.  mere true belief

    are parallel to examples with the type of performance you chose.
    Explain why Sosa denies that apt performances must be safe. Why does
    Sosa's distinction between animal knowledge and reflective knowledge
    become important once this is recognized? List two major attractions
    of Sosa's view. If you think the view doesn't ultimately succeed,
    explain why. If you think that it does succeed, explain why you are
    unconvinced by one of the objections we discussed in class.
7.  Explain what foundationalism says in its most generic form, and how
    foundationalists try to resolve the Pyrrhonian Problematic. Then,
    explain two specific versions of foundationalism (e.g.,
    infallibility foundationalism, acquaintance foundationalism, Pryor's
    view), giving two objections to each. Explain how one might
    construct a revised version of foundationalism that avoids these
    objections. At the end, explain whether and why you think the
    generic foundationalist thesis is true or false.

### Reponse

#### Question 1

##### Justified True Belief

Since Aristotle, the literature of epistemology has been centered on the
Justified True Belief (JTB) theory of knowledge. The theory being that a
person $S$ knows that $P$ if and only if

1.  $P$ is true.
2.  $S$ believes that $P$, and
3.  $S$ is justified in believing that $P$.

These have been speculated to be both necessary and sufficient
conditions, meaning that if $S$ lacks any of them, $S$ does not know,
and (supposedly) if $S$ has all of them, in *every case* $S$ knows. A
prime example is a mathematical proof, where $S$ is presented with the
demonstration of $P$, comes to believe $P$ on the grounds of the valid
proof, and the proof is of the Pythagorean theorem, which is true. This
fits really well with intuition, this gloss feels clean, light, like a
suitable definition.

##### Gettier's Counterexample

In his 1963 paper, "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?", Edmund Gettier
ingeniously comes to what he thinks is a counterexample to the (JTB)
model. Gettier has the reader not that for the proposition $P$, where it
entails $Q$, if $S$ is justified in believing $P$, then $S$ is also
justified in believing $Q$. This is perfectly non-offensive and obvious,
but Gettier shows that this can lead to $S$ justifiable believing
something that is *in fact* false. These examples can take two logical
forms, abusing the "and" and "or" operators.

Imagine that $S$ goes out to the bar where he meets $D$ and $F$. $F$ is
quite the drinker, has been taking shots the whole time, and is behaving
noticeably intoxicated. $D$ is quite the talker, and tells $S$ that she
is a DJ. She shows $S$ pictures of DJ gear, tells vivid stories, and
reliably answers questions about the vocation. $S$ comes to justifiably
believe that $D$ is a DJ. $S$ has just taken an undergraduate class in
logic, and eager to use that new knowledge, notes that "$D$ is a DJ or
$F$ is sober" is a true proposition because of $S$'s belief that $D$ is
a DJ. As it turns out, $D$ is a huge liar and self-obsessed.
Furthermore, $F$ just likes the excuse of intoxication so that
socializing is easier, and has an agreement with the barman about only
being served water. Notice that $S$ *believed* *justifiably* a *true*
proposition, that "$D$ is a DJ or $F$ is sober," and that it is tempting
to say that $S$ still does not know. So something is missing from (JTB)!

##### Harman's Response

In *Thought*, Gilbert Harman believes it is easy to respond to this sort
or counterexample to (JTB). Harman sees that the problem with Gettier
cases is that $S$ has false grounds for justifiably believing a true
proposition. So, reasonably, Harman notes that if a "no false grounds"
clause (NFG) was added as another necessary and sufficient condition to
(JTB), these Gettier cases could be accounted for. More formally, $S$
knows that $P$ if and only if all conditions of (JTB) and all of $S$'s
grounds for believing $P$ are true. Unfortunately (JTB + NFG) does not
work because it is equally susceptible to Gettier cases.

Imagine that $S$ is still at the bar when he gets a call from his
friend. His friend, $G$, is just recently single, and is looking to get
back into the dating world. $G$ asks $S$ what the party is like, and $S$
is looking at someone, $H$, who is just $G$'s type, so $S$ comments that
the party is just the type that $G$ wants to be at. $S$ is a really good
judge of character and knows $G$ really well, so assume he has
impeccable visual and other evidence of their going well together.
Unbeknownst to $S$, it is actually LGBT night at this particular bar,
and it so happens that $G$ is heterosexual. But it also so happens that
$S$ was right about $H$ being a $G$'s type, but $H$ was at the bar with
a LGBT friend. Here, $S$ does not reason from anything false, but he
does not know because had he turned his attention to any other person he
would have noticed that it was LGBT night and that $G$ would not enjoy
it.

#### Question 3

##### Goldman's theory

In his "A Causal Theory of Knowing," Alvin Goldman takes a specific
Gettier case, analyzes it, and generalizes it to a new take on the old
"$S$ knows that $P$." He begins with the case where $S$ has good grounds
for believing that

> ​(Q) Jones owns a Ford.

As a logic game, $S$ notices that it is true that

> ​(P) Either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona.

As in all Gettier cases, this belief is a (JTB), and it also so happens
that Jones *does not* own a Ford by Brown *is in* Barcelona. What
Goldman wants to say about this is that what makes (P) true is that fact
that Brown is in Barcelona, but the fact that Brown is in Barcelona has
nothing to do with $S$ believing that (P). The requirement of a **causal
connection** is what Goldman wants to add to (JTB). Goldman posits that
there has to be a *proper sort* of causal chain between belief and
justification. Formally, Goldman's theory is as follows,

> (JTB+ACC) $S$ knows that $P$ if and only if the fact $P$ is causally
> connected in an appropriate way with $S$'s believing $P$.

This means that $S$'s belief fails because the causal connection is
lacking, and this is the right outcome.

##### Counterexamples

It is possible to explain Goldman theory with this (as we shall see) too
simple formulation, which is:

> (Too Simple) $S$ knows that $P$ if and only if $S$'s belief that $P$
> is caused by the fact that $P$.

In order to understand how this is not the same as (JTB+ACC), imagine a
case where $S$'s belief that $P$ is cause by $P$'s truth, but $S$ does
not know because the chain is inappropriate. For instance, imagine that
$S$ is very, very religious and has a book that he will believe whatever
is found inside. $G$ is a mathematician and really respects $S$'s
religiosity. $G$ decides to express this respect by, unbeknownst to $S$,
writing in $S$'s book the conclusions of many mathematical proofs. When
$S$ comes to read them, being very religious, accepts them
unquestionably. In this case, (Too Simple) fails because $S$'s belief
that $P$ is actually caused by the fact that $P$, which $G$ discovered
and shared. But still, if $G$ had written down the wrong formulas, $S$
would have still believed, the intuition is that $S$ did not know. While
some may think that this is chain of events is also a counterexample to
(JTB+ACC), Goldman would say that this is not an "appropriate" way for
$S$'s believing. In this way, (JTB+ACC) gets a different result to (Too
Simple), and so is distinct.

This pattern of counterexample can be generalized. The way that it works
is by the fact that the belief is in some sense causally connected with
the truth of the belief, but it somehow not plugged into the world in
the right way. Alternatively, that the subject was only luckily holding
the right belief through this chain.

A classic manifestation of this pattern is the papiere-mache barn case.
It is as follows,

> Henry drives into a part of the state that he's never visited before.
> He is looking at a real barn, and has impeccable visual and other
> evidence that it is a barn. His justification is sound in every way.
> However, in the rest of this unusual part of the state there only
> fake, papiere-mache barns, any of which would have fooled Henry into
> thinking it was a barn.

The explanation of this is that Henry sees a barn and forms not
inferential beliefs about it, he just accepts that what he sees is a
barn. This belief is true and justified. The reason it is a problem for
both (JTB) and more specifically (JTB+ACC) is that Henry does not rely
on a false inference. The causal process in this case is one of
perception, which Goldman notes is a highly reliable one (along with
memory). Yet this causal process which is hooked up to the world and the
truth in the right way still falls short of knowledge, so it is a
counterexample to (JTB+ACC).

Another terrific (or devastating ...) type of counterexample to
Goldman's (JTB+ACC) are ones where the subject is given true beliefs
about the world, "veritable," but those beliefs are caused by a third
party. A common way of instantiating it is to imagine a "boring
neuroscientist" who causes in a subject, who is a brain in a vat,
nothing but veritable delusions. The world that this subject has access
to represents the world outside of the vat exactly, and the subject
comes to form justified true beliefs which a causally connected to the
facts. Yet, this subject does not know these things.

##### Response

I think that there is still hope for the causal theory of knowledge. The
failures of the theory with epistemic luck, deviant causal chains, and
veritable delusions is failure to understand which chains are
"appropriate." This is not a catch-all for any instance when intuition
disagrees with (JTB+ACC), but rather a challenge to discover the means
by which we can acceptably come to know things. The reason I think there
is still hope for appropriate causal chains is because my model of mind
is a naturalistic and my model of reality is deterministic. This
encourages me about a causal theory because I think that all
perceptions, memories, and inferences are actually natural events within
the brain. I hope that with a better understanding of the inner-workings
of the brain and a better understanding of how the brain collects
information from the world, a rigorous and intuitive definition of
"appropriate" can be formulated.

#### Question 7

##### The Pyrrhonian Problematic

The Pyrrhonian Problematic is an extreme version of skepticism. While
the view is self-debasing in the sense that accepting the view entails
one's being unable to hold the view, a formulation of it would look
something like this:

1.  One must be justified in believing.
2.  There are only three ways to be justified:
    1.  Infinitely based on non-repeating justification,
    2.  Recursively justified (circularly), or
    3.  Ending the justifications at a *foundational* justification.

3.  Infinite justification is impossible, unacceptable.
4.  Recursive justification is not justification.
5.  Foundational justification is arbitrary.
6.  Therefore, justification is impossible.

##### Generic foundationalism

The answer that the foundationalist gives to the Pyrrhonian is that some
foundational justification is not arbitrary. Some beliefs are
*non-inferentially justified*. More formally, there exist
non-inferentially justified true beliefs that an epistemic agent derives
all other beliefs from. Examples of beliefs that might be
non-inferentially justified are ones formed immediately by perception,
like Henry noticing the barn in papiere-mache barn country. Or perhaps
the subject $S$ noticing the truth of a mathematical proof is becoming
immediately acquainted with truth.

As these two examples show, there are different ways that a belief could
be non-inferentially justified. For instance, some foundationalists
think that $S$'s belief that $P$ is non-inferentially justified if and
only if $S$'s believing that $P$ entails that $P$ is true, which is
called infalliblism. This would mean that everything that is necessarily
true is non-inferentially justified, which is unlikely. This is unlikely
because imagine that $S$ is presented and accepts the proof Euler's
formula. It is not tempting to say that this is non-inferentially
justified belief. Furthermore, the connection between truth and belief
is so strong that skepticism likely follows from this theory.

There is also "acquaintance foundationalism." Its formal definition is:

> $S$ is non-inferentially justified in believing that $P$ if and only
> if $S$ is directly acquainted with the fact that $P$, her thought that
> $P$, and the relation of correspondence between the fact and the
> thought.

This theory suffers from an issue when $S$ is presented with something
like a "many speckled hen." Imagine that the hen has 47 speckles. $S$ is
directly acquainted with the fact that the hen has 47 speckles when the
hen comes in to her visual experience, and $S$ has the thought (in some
way) that the hen has 47 speckles. Yet, despite this, unless $S$ is
"rain man", she likely does not *know* that the hen has 47 speckles,
despite this acquaintance.

I think generic foundationalism is true and that the right modifications
could allow it to correctly explain all of these cases. Foundationalism
has to be fitted for human perception in that it correctly accounts for
those perceptual qualities that human beings can reliably distinguish
and those that confuse the human senses, those not included in inherent
human competencies. I believe this, in part, because if the Pyrrhonian
trilemma is not a false trilemma, then the only way we could come to
know things was from basic, non-inferential, brute justification. And
because I think we do come to know things (this is an intuition), I
think the solution must be non-inferential justification. Furthermore,
my model of mind and reality is a causally deterministic one, which
leads me to think that there are low-level causal chains which give rise
to basic concepts in the mind. These truths may be too basic for
high-level human language, which is based on thought, to describe. This
type of formulation would be difficult because it is hinged on a
low-level understanding of the brain and how the sense-data comes to be
consumed by the brain. The vocabulary needed to restrict non-inferential
justification via sense data includes terms like order of magnitude and
"on/off" ordered states of small clusters of neurons.

### "Is Knowledge Easy — or Impossible?" <small>by James Van Cleve</small>

-   Cleve has defeneded the idea that we obtain knowledge of the
    reliability of our faculties with the faculties,
    -   People think this is circular.

-   It requires epistemic externalism.
    -   Any argument that says we can have knowledge of the reliability
        of a faculty using the faculty makes knowledge too easy.
    -   In what follows, Cleve presses the suggestion that the only
        alternative to such externalism is skepticism.
        -   This is important because those that reject the circularity
            likely do not want to embrace skepticism.
        -   Usually these people believe this is a false dilemma, and
            try for the medium between the externalist's easy knowledge
            and the skeptic's unattainable knowledge.

#### Varieties of Externalism

-   He is going to define internalisms positively and externalisms as
    the rejection of the preceding internalism.
    -   The core tenet of the internalist view is:

        > There is no first-order knowledge unless there is also
        > higher-order knowledge with respect to the factors that make
        > first-order knowledge possible.

    -   Theories that fit under this slogan may vary in two dimensions:
        1.  The *object* of higher-order knowledge
            1.  That the knowledge-making or knowledge-conferring factor
                *obtains*
            2.  That the factor, whatever it may be, has "justificatory
                efficacy."

        2.  The *nature* of higher-order knowledge
            1.  Must the higher-order knowledge be:
                1.  Actual? or
                2.  Potential?

            2.  Must the knowledge arise or be obtainable:
                1.  In some prescribed way, typically by reflection
                    alone
                2.  In any way?

-   The externalism that will be important is that one where it's denied
    that a subject need actually know that the factors justifiying his
    belief or giving hum knowledge or reliable indicators of truth.
-   For a reliabalist, the fact that the subject's belief has been
    produced by a reliable process is enough for justification.
-   But reliabalism is not the only variety of externalism,

    > The concept of epistemic justification is ... internal ... in that
    > one can find out directly, by *reflection*, what one is justified
    > in believin at any given time.

    -   This makes him an internalist in the two senses from above:

        > One is justified by some factor in believing something one
        > must be able to know by reflection both that the factor
        > obtains and does not confer justification on belief in that
        > belief.

    -   There are sources of justification or knowledge that deliver
        their goods even if the subject does not know they are reliable
        for Chisholm.

-   The "track-record argument":

    > 1.  At $t_1$, I formed the perceptual belief that $p$, and $p$.
    > 2.  At $t_2$, I formed the perceptual belief that $q$, and $q$.
    > 3.  Therefore, sense perception is a reliable source of belief.

-   There is a strong tendency to regard such arguments as circular.
    -   Is that the second conject in each premise could be known only
        on the basis of sense perception.

-   Externalism suggests that what needs to be added is knowledge of
    reliability.

    > **(KR)**: A source $K$ yields knowledge for a subject if and only
    > if $S$ knows that $K$ is reliable.

#### (KR) as Leading to Skepticism

-   We find ourselves in the following predicament:
    1.  We can know that a deliverance of $K$ is true if and only if we
        first know that $K$ is reliable.
    2.  We can know that $K$ is realiable if and only if we first know,
        concerning certain of its deliverances, that they are true.

-   If both are true, skepticism is the only option.

#### The Reidian Alternative

-   Basic first principles:
    1.  The exitence of all things which I am concious.
    2.  That those things I remember did really happen.
    3.  That we perceive by our senses is really what we perceive.
    4.  The natural faculties we distinguish truth from error are not
        fallacious.

-   The set of thoughts is contained within the set of senses, and the
    set of senses are contained within the set of events.
    -   Everything natural is in the set of events.
    -   Thoughts are events.

-   The process of (a) is one in which a conditional event, an event
    conditional on other events, comes to be triggered.
    -   The event of coming to sense a table is conditional on their
        being a table in that the lack of the table would result in the
        lack of the sense-event.

-   The process of (b) is one in which sense events are aggregated and
    synthesized by our mind.
    -   The actual table triggers the mental event of sensing it, which
        triggers the thoughts about the table.

-   There are events which occur external to our mind.
    -   They have properties, spatial, temporal, and natural.
    -   These properties are abstractable to "information."

-   Senses causally detect at least some of the events and at least some
    of the information.
    -   Our senses are limited in that they capture a subset of the
        available information about events.

-   Our thoughts have access to the information accrued from the senses.
    -   This forms an internal model of the external world.

-   Thoughts and thinking are a complex, specific case of sense,
    perception, which are complex, conditional events. They are the
    aggregation of many basic sensory perceptions, and the ordering and
    synthesis of perception.
    -   Thinking and reasoning are a form of sensing that do not have a
        way of directly interacting with events.

-   Senses are a type of event which is about another event, events
    which rely on other events for their content.

#### Explanatory power

-   Knowledge is when the thought-event is of an actual event which came
    through sense-events.
    -   Gettier cases are not knowledge because the actual event isn't
        "actual" and it does not come through the senses, the
        "knowledge" occurs without the appropriate sense, it is a
        sense-independant thought which does not represent an event.

-   We have evolved to distinguish relevant information from events, and
    perception is the process of taking events as input (a) and sending
    a translation to the language of thought to the higher faculties
    (b).
    -   Evolution is the process of increasing the complexity of a
        system given energy, becoming increasingly fit in being better
        at reproducing. Because we're here and a far greater number of
        possible beings aren't, we have good reason to believe our
        senses are more apt at distinguishing events which make
        repoduction more likely.

### "Basic Knowledge and the Problem of Easy Knowledge." <small>by Stewart Cohen</small>

#### Basic Knowledge and the KR Principle

-   The problem is that we can't use anything but our senses to
    determine if our senses are reliable except our senses.
    Bootstrapping.

    > **(KR)**: A potential knowledge source $K$ can yield knowledge for
    > $S$, only if $S$ knows $K$ is reliable.

-   An evidentialist is someone who denies one can know $P$ on the basis
    of evidence $E$ without knowing that $E$ is a reliable indication of
    $P$

#### The Problem of Easy Knowledge: Closure

> If $S$ knows $P$ and $S$ knows $P$ entails $Q$, then $S$ knows (or at
> least is in a position to know) $Q$.

-   Nozick uses his view to deny closure.

> If $S$ knows $P$ on the basis of $R$, and $D$ is a defeater of $R$ as
> a reason to believe $P$, then $S$ knows $D$ is false.

June 27th, 2013 <small>Lecture: Testimony and Justification</small>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

-   There are various pathways to knowledge.
    -   Some pathways are **generative**
        -   Perception, for example.

    -   Some pathways are **preservative**
        -   Inference

-   There are controversies about how to classify certain sources of
    knowledge. - You may think that they are preservative in that the
    follow way:\
     \> It's natural to think that what memory does is transmit \> some
    peice of knoweldge or justified belief from one's \> earlier self to
    one's later self.

-   A strong version of preservative view of testimony is that in order
    to come know $P$ from testimony, the testifier must know $P$.
-   Lackey thinks that people who don't know something can come to have
    you know that P. \> **JP**: If $S$ reports that $P$ to $H$ and $H$
    has no defeaters for \> $S$'s report that $P$, then $H$ is justified
    in accepting that \> $P$ on the basis of $S$'s testimony.

### Instructions

Write a paper of 6–10 pages (double-spaced) on a topic below. You are
more than welcome to invent your own topic. Just create a prompt and
pass it by me first.

### Topics

1.  Which of the approaches to the Gettier problem gets closest to
    solving it, in your view? Explain the solution and compare and
    contrast it with some others, making clear why it fares better. Then
    anticipate and answer some objections to it. If some supposed
    Gettier cases are left unexplained, explain why we shouldn't take
    them seriously.
2.  To know that P, do you need to be in a position to know that you
    know that P? If you answer 'yes', defend your answer with at least
    three arguments, and consider and rebut at least two objections. If
    you answer 'no', give a theoretical argument for your conclusion,
    and also give some examples where you think it is clear that someone
    knows that P without being in a position to know whether she knows
    that P.
3.  Is all circularity vicious? If 'no', what is the difference between
    epistemically vicious and epistemically benign circularity?
4.  Is a brain in a vat with all the same experiences, apparent
    memories, and other internal states as you really equally justified
    in believing everything as you? If you think there is a difference
    in justification, what accounts for it, and how can you explain
    intuitions to the contrary? If you think there is no difference, why
    care about justification? Wouldn't this show that justification is
    irrelevant to the goal of truth?
5.  Can the generality problem for process reliabilism be solved?
6.  Can a more sophisticated form of coherentism avoid the objections we
    discussed in class? (Feel free to focus on a subset of those
    objections to add focus to the paper.)
7.  Cohen and others claim that every view that allows for one to gain
    knowledge via a source without antecedently knowing that the source
    is reliable will legitimate some form of vicious bootstrapping (a la
    Vogel's Roxanne case). Explain the argument in favor of this claim.
    Is this claim true? If true, what should we make of it? If false,
    what is wrong with the argument?
8.  Can perceptual seemings (and other sorts of seemings, such as
    apparent memories) provide some justification all on their own? If
    so, what is the relevant difference between a perceptual seeming and
    a belief? If not, is this because seemings are too much like
    beliefs? (If so, how are seemings like beliefs? How are they
    evaluable?)
9.  Can modest internalists like Pryor avoid the problem of the speckled
    hen?
10. Is Sosa's distinction between animal knowledge and reflective
    knowledge a real distinction? Is it really plausible that we have
    the former in Fake Barn Country?
11. What is the best argument for skepticism, and where does it go
    wrong?
