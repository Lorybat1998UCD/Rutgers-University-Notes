Theory of Knowledge <small>with Kurt Sylvan</small>
===================================================

Syllabus
--------

### Course Description

Epistemology is a major branch of philosophy dedicated to questions
about the nature and structure of knowledge, justified belief, evidence,
good inference, etc. Examples of central questions include:

-   What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge?
-   To gain knowledge from a reliable source, does one also need to know
    that the source is reliable?
-   Must all beliefs be justified by other beliefs, or are there some
    non-inferentially justified beliefs?
-   Are the factors that make for justified belief all internal, or are
    some external?
-   Is evidence necessary for justified belief? If so, is good evidence
    *all* one needs for justification?
-   Do we know anything? Can we answer the skeptic? (Must we answer the
    skeptic?)

We will read and argue about some classic answers to these questions
(and others) in the class.

### Readings

Many readings will come from Epistemology: An Anthology (eds. Sosa, Kim,
Fantl and McGrath). I also recommend (but don't require) reading from
Richard Fumerton's introductory book Epistemology. These books and
almost everything else that we will read are available on the Sakai site
for the class. A few background readings will also be drawn from the
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, which is [free
online](plato.standford.edu).

### Assignments, Grading and Policies

Your grade will be based on:

1.  *Discussion Board Comments/Questions*. You are responsible for
    posting
    (I) some questions about the reading or (II) some critical comments
        or objections to the arguments in the reading on the Discussion
        Board on Sakai. These can be anywhere from a few sentences to
        several pages what matters is that they help you learn the
        material. You should post these, at latest, at 9:00 on the night
        before the class meeting. Each of you should do this for 5
        meetings of your choosing. This is for 20% of the grade.

2.  *Attendance and Participation*. You must the class regularly to do
    well and avoid getting lost. I will allow one unexcused absence, and
    you will be penalized for every subsequent unexcused absence. You
    are also encouraged to participate by talking as much as possible.
    This will be for 10% of the grade.
3.  *Exam*. There will be a take-home mid-term exam. I'll hand out
    questions on 6/13 and you will have a week to write answers to them,
    and hand them into me in printed form on 6/20. This is for 30% of
    the grade.
4.  *Final Paper*. A final paper of 6-10 pages is due on 7/4 or earlier
    by email. I'll post topics on 6/13. You can also design your own
    topic, but you must pass it by me first. This is for 40% of the
    grade. Do not plagiarize on your papers! This is severely penalized
    by the University and easy to detect.

### Contact Information and Office Hours

You can contact me via ksylvan@philosophy.rutgers.edu. I will hold
office hours in Seminary 1, Room 012 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from
4:00-5:30. Feel free to arrange an appointment with me if you can't make
the office hours and have any questions or want to discuss your work.

### The Search for the Tether and the JTB Theory

#### Plato’s Tether

Our question for the next several meetings:

<div class="lead">
(Q) What distinguishes knowledge from a lucky guess (or a mere true
    opinion)?
    </div>

​(Q) goes back to the *Meno*, where Plato puts a metaphorical answer in
Socrates’ mouth:

> SOCRATES: True opinions, for as long as they remain, are fine things
> and do nothing but good. But they don’t hang around for long; they
> escape from a man’s mind, so that they are not worth much until one
> tethers them with chains of reasons why. [...] That is why knowledge
> is prized more highly than correct opinion; knowledge differs from
> correct opinion in being tethered down.
>
> MENO: Yes, by Zeus, Socrates, it does seem to go something like that.

#### JTB

But what is this tether? Socrates suggests that it consists in a *chain
of reasons why*. A natural way to make this more precise is to think
that what distinguishes K from mere TB is *justification*: someone who
makes more than a lucky guess is *justified* in believing as she does.
Exactly what justification involves is a huge question. For the moment,
let’s just use the intuitive idea, and consider this answer to (Q):

> **(JTB)** Justification is what distinguishes knowledge from a lucky
> guess.

In other words: knowledge $=$ justified true belief.

After this suggestion hit the philosophical newsstand, little changed
for the ensuing 2300+ years. Even in the first half of the 20th century,
JTB was accepted in some form or another. One can find versions, e.g.,
in Chisholm and Ayer:

> **(Ayer's view)** $S$ knows that $P$ iff (i) $S$ is sure that $P$,
> (ii) $S$ has the right to be sure that $P$, and (iii) $P$ is true.

<!-- -->

> **(Chisholm's view)** $S$ knows that $P$ iff (i) $S$ accepts $P$, (ii)
> $S$ has adequate evidence for $P$, and (iii) $P$ is true.

#### Elements of JTB

Before moving on, it’s worth saying a bit about the elements of the JTB
theory, since it isn’t wholly uncontroversial that each is really
necessary for knowledge:

-   **Belief**: It’s plausible that one can’t know some proposition
    without at least believing it. This is witnessed by the absurdity of
    sentences like: ’I know that it’s raining but I am not sure that
    it’s raining’. This simply sounds incoherent. Nonetheless, there are
    some cases where one can put pressure on the belief condition.
    Consider:

-   **Exam**: Albert is quizzed on English history. One question is:
    ‘When did Queen Elizabeth die?’ Albert doesn’t think he knows, but
    answers the question correctly, by writing that Elizabeth died in
    1603. Moreover, he gives correct answers to many other questions to
    which he didn’t think he knew the answer.

    -   There’s some temptation to say that Albert knows that Elizabeth
        died in 1603 but doesn’t believe that she died in 1603.

    -   Still, we need to distinguish between implicit and explicit
        belief. Consider someone who has a prejudice against some group
        of people and is disposed to treat them as inferior. This person
        may explicitly deny that he has this prejudice, and not believe
        that he has it. Still, given his behavior, it seems appropriate
        to ascribe him as having the *implicit* belief that members of
        this group are inferior. Given the distinction between implicit
        and explicit belief, it is also plausible that Albert does at
        least *implicitly* believe that Elizabeth died in 1603.

-   **Truth**: Sometimes we say things like ‘I just *knew* it was going
    to happen. But then it didn’t!’ These claims don’t sound incoherent.
    But wouldn’t they be incoherent if knowing that P entailed P? The
    epistemologist’s response is to allow that the English word ‘knows’
    might be used non-literally to express the speaker’s *feeling* of
    knowing.
    -   Still, once we are engaged in philosophical elucidation, it is
        more helpful to distinguish between the mere feeling of knowing
        and actual knowing (assuming there is *some* actual knowing,
        *pace* radical skeptics). Perhaps the *word* can express both.
        But as long as we can *conceptually* distinguish the two we can
        simply recognize that the JTB theory isn’t about the feeling of
        knowing but about actual knowing.

-   **Justification**: A large can of worms. We’ll see that some major
    epistemologists have denied that justification is really necessary
    for knowledge. One can get the feeling for this by simply thinking
    again about exam. If Albert does know that Elizabeth died in 1603,
    what *justification* could he possibly have for believing that she
    died in 1603? It sure seems that he doesn’t have *evidence* for
    believing this.
    -   The main response to this challenge is to insist that being
        justified in believing something needn’t consist in having
        evidence for believing something, though evidence is *one* way
        to get justified. Perhaps, for example, reliable sources like
        memory and intuition, etc., can yield justified beliefs that
        don’t require independent evidence.

### Gettier: JTB ≠ K

Gettier’s little paper presents two simple counterexamples to JTB. As
we’ll be seeing, there are heaps of similar cases that pop up to
undermine revisions of JTB (i.e., ‘JTB+’ views).

> **(Case I)** Smith has strong evidence for the following proposition:
>
> (P) Jones will get the job and has ten coins in his pocket.
>
> This entails:
>
> (Q) Someone who has ten coins in his pocket will get the job. By
>     coincidence, Smith rather than Jones will get the job. Smith also
>     has ten coins in his pocket, though he doesn’t realize it. So, (Q)
>     is true and Smith is justified in believing (Q).

But Smith does not know (Q).

> **(Case II)** Smith has strong evidence for the following proposition:
>
> (R) Jones owns a Ford.
>
> This entails
>
> (S) Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Boston.
>
> Smith deductively infers (S) from (R), and so justifiedly believes
> (S). By chance, Brown is in Boston, and (S) is true only for this
> reason.

But Smith does not know (S).

There are more intuitive cases that one could give that have this
structure. Consider:

> **(Sheep in the Field)** Smith goes for a drive in the country. He
> looks off into a field and sees what looks exactly like a sheep. So he
> justifiably believes:
>
> That animal in the field is a sheep.
>
> Smith’s son is in the back seat reading a book and not looking at the
> scenery. He asks if there are any sheep in the field they are passing.
> Smith says ‘Yes’, adding:
>
> There is a sheep in the field.
>
> Smith is justified by what he sees in believing (1). (2) follows from
> (1), so he is justified in believing (2). As it turns out, (1) is
> false: what Smith sees is a sheep dog. But (2) is true anyway: there’s
> a real sheep just behind the sheep dog which Smith can’t see.

### A Cheap Response: No False Grounds

Gettier gives us the recipe he used for generating these particular
cases in the paper. Cases I and II are simply cases where (i) one is
justified in believing something false but (ii) infers something true
from it using a good method. The inferred true belief will be justified
given:

> **(Deductive J-Closure)** For any proposition P, if S is justified in
> believing P, P entails Q, and S deduces Q from P and accepts Q as a
> result of this deduction, then S is justified in believing Q.

Seeing this, some people in the early literature thought it was easy to
revise JTB to avoid Gettier’s problem. They suggested:

> **(JTB+No False Grounds)** S knows that P iff (i) S believes that P,
> (ii) P is true, (iii) S is justified in believing P, and (iv) all of
> S’s grounds for believing P are true.

But this proposal faces two problems: it is too weak and too strong.
First, it is easy to construct cases where the subject doesn’t reason
from any false premises. Consider:

> Henry drives into a part of the state that he’s never visited before.
> He is looking at a real barn, and has impeccable visual and other
> evidence that it is a barn. His justification is sound in every way.
> However, in the rest of this unusual part of the state there only
> fake, papiere-mache barns, any of which would have fooled Henry into
> thinking it was a barn.

Here, Henry doesn’t engage in any inference at all: he just looks at the
barn and believes that there’s a barn there. He does not reason from
anything false. Still, he doesn’t know. For it is just by sheer luck
that he finds himself in front of the one real barn in the area.

Another reason why JTB+No False Grounds fails is that it’s too strong.
We *can* sometimes know things even though some of our grounds for
belief are false. Consider:

> Smith has two independent sets of reasons for thinking that someone in
> his office owns a Ford. One set of reasons has to do with the wily
> Nogot, who says that he owns a Ford, drives around a Ford (which isn’t
> really his, unbeknownst to Smith), etc. But Smith has equally strong
> reasons having to do with Havit. And Havit does own a Ford.

In this kind of case, Smith might reason to the true conclusion that
someone in his office owns a Ford from the whole set of reasons, some of
which are false. Intuitively, Smith can still know that someone in his
office owns a Ford even though *some* of these reasons are false. But
JTB+No False Grounds predicts otherwise. So JTB+No False Grounds fails.

### Epistemic Luck

If one wants to solve the Gettier problem while holding onto a broadly
JTB+ theory, the strategy will be to (i) find an element that all
Gettier cases have in common and (ii) add to JTB a clause that says that
this element must be absent. We’ve seen one unpromising way to do
thisthe ‘no false grounds’ view. But in seeing why this view failed, we
got a hint of a more abstract feature that these cases share. Remember
what we said about Henry in fake barn country: ‘It is *just by sheer
luck* that he finds himself in front of the one real barn in the area’.

This does seem to be an important feature of the cases we’ve seen so
far. In all of them, the person lands on a true belief only by luck. It
was a sheer coincidence in Case I that Smith himself also had 10 coins
in his pocket. It was a sheer coincidence in Case II that Smith happened
to infer a disjunction whose second disjunct (i.e., that Brown is in
Boston) was true. He could so easily have inferred a different
disjunction whose second disjunct was false. It was a sheer coincidence
in Sheep in the Field that there was a real sheep hiding behind the
sheepdog. Etc.

This isn’t to say that these people engaged in *lucky guessing*. They
were justified in believing what they believed. So, there’s a different
kind of luck that arises in Gettier cases.

Now, we can’t just say that *no* kind of luckily true belief is
compatible with knowledge. Consider some other examples where knowledge
isn’t missing.

-   It’s in some sense a matter of luck that I’m in this room. The last
    five years could so easily have been different, if slight changes
    were made to the years before them. But that doesn’t mean that I
    don’t know that there are students in this room.

-   Furthermore, if I look out the window and happen to see something
    really rare and bizarre, it hardly follows that I can’t know that
    this rare and bizarre thing is happening. Still, there’s a sense in
    which the beliefs I form are true by luck.

-   Another example from Ichikawa and Steup: ‘Suppose that someone
    enters a raffle and wins an encyclopedia, then reads various of its
    entries, correcting many of his previous misapprehensions. There is
    a sense in which the resultant beliefs are true only by luckfor our
    subject was very lucky to have won that rafflebut this is not the
    sort of luck, intuitively, that interferes with the possession of
    knowledge.’

So, how should we understand the luck that matters? This question is as
hard to answer as the Gettier problem is to solve. So we can’t solve the
Gettier problem with a theory like:

-   **(JTB+No Luck)** S knows that P iff (i) S believes that P, (ii) P
    is true, (iii) S is justified in believing P, and (iv) S doesn’t
    believe truly merely by luck.

This simply provides a new label for the problem without solving it.

Still, it does point us in a helpful direction. If we could provide an
analysis of the *relevant* notion of a belief’s being true merely by
luck, we might stand a chance of solving the Gettier problem. So we’ve
made some progress: we’ve ruled out one unhelpful approach and have
gotten a grip on a strategy that will guide us. In future meetings,
we’ll see some proposals that might help us to understand the nature of
epistemic luck.

### Gettier

-   Some people try to make a strong connection between knowledge and
    justification.
    -   Since Gettier, people have dropped this for "JTB+ view"

-   The story is that Gettier was up for tenure review, and his
    publication history wasn't great.
    -   So he quickly cooked up this paper "Is Justified True Belief
        Knowledge?"

-   The article consists of 2 counterexamples about the belief that
    knowledge contains justified true beliefs (JTB).

### Epistemic Luck

-   There are some scientific theories that assume things that just
    cannot be true.
    -   Like Newton's theory of gravitation, not as good as relativity.
    -   You can come to know true things from false premises.

May 30th, 2013 <small>Lecture</small>
-------------------------------------

-   We looked at the original Gettier in the last class and saw how JTB
    is not knowledge.
    -   Perhaps no false assumptions?
    -   Today we'll see a more sophisticated version of this.

### Defeasibility Theories and Objective Defeaters

-   Before Harman, there is another tradition that Harman criticizes.
    -   The theory was the "defeasibility theory."

-   On one hand, we talk about evidence in an objective sense, and we
    search for facts.
    -   There's **objective evidence**, evidence which is "out there,"
        but they are facts that we do not have access to.
    -   Then **possessed evidence**, which is what we actually have.

-   With this there are two kinds of normative statuses:
    -   A **correct belief** is one that is supported by all objective
        evidence that exists.
    -   An **epistemically rational** belief is one supported by the
        evidence we have.

-   There are two types of defeaters, for two kinds of defeat:
    -   A **rebutting defeater** is a counter-example, or evidence to
        suggest the opposition.
    -   A **undercutting defeater** undermines your evidence, like
        learning that your source was faulty. It says nothing about the
        fact of the matter.

-   All of people had a stipulative definition of an objective defeater
    that does not lead to a "true/undefeated" proposition.
    -   The stated objections rely on the definition.

-   Objective defeaters are the evidence you do not have in a Gettier
    case.

### Harman's Theory

-   He provides a more sophisticated version, the reasons why it's more
    sophisticated:
    -   He adds the condition that it has to be the case that you don't
        essentially rely on any false ground.
        -   If you know you must have no false grounds, which predicts
            the wrong things.

    -   Widen the notion of inferences, and allow for them to all be
        knowledge, there are these cases that look like non-inferential
        cases.
        -   In the fake barns case, you're relying on the assumption
            that conditions are normal, that appearance reliably
            correspondends to reality.

### Goldman's Theory

-   According to Goldman, what's going on in Gettier cases is causal.
    -   The holding a belief and the facts are not casually related, and
        that's what's wrong.

-   You have knowledge if and only if you have there is an appropriate
    causal relationship between the justification and the
    truth/knowledge.
    -   Where is the "appropriateness."

-   There are "deviant causal chains" where things are wholly related to
    the facts in an intuitively non-perceptual, false-memory, etc, way.

### “Knowledge and Skepticism” <small>Robert Nozick</small>

#### Knowledge

-   Our task is to formulate further conditions to go alongside:

> (1) $p$ is true.
>
> (2) $S$ believes that $p$.
>
-   We want:
    -   Each condition to be necessary.
    -   Jointly sufficient for knowlege.

-   The causal condition on knowledge is inhospitiable to mathematical
    and ethical knowledge.
-   Consider the third condition (two formulations):

> (3) If $p$ weren't true, $S$ woudn't believe that $p$.
>
> (4) $\lnot p \to \lnot B(S, p)$
>

-   Now we're going to talk about theories that hold that it's just an
    accident that people form JTBs.
-   It's reasonable if you think about someone infering from Jones
    owning a Ford to something false, and then you notice that while
    it's justified, it is an accident.
    -   People want to give an account of the accident.
    -   Non-accidentality

### The Tether in Modal Terms

-   When philosophers talk about modality, they are talking about
    statements like "could", "would" "must."
-   The counterfactual or subjenctive conditional statement is of the
    form:

> If it were true that $A$, it would be true that $C$.

-   Philosophers have used "nearby possible worlds" as a concept
    recently.

-   These are distinct logical conditions
-   Order in questions:
    -   First order questions are like "does $P$ know that $S$?" $$Kp$$

    -   Second order questions are "does $P$ know that $P$ knows $S$?"
        $$KKp$$

-   A good analogy is like thermometers: A thermometer that says 70
    degrees but is broken is not right when it is actually 70 degrees.

### Nozick and Sensitivity

-   Nozick notices that there is a counterexample which he calls the
    (Grandma) case.
    -   When her grandson is doing well, she observes that he is doing
        well.
    -   When he is not doing well, the family make her believe he is.

-   The way that he accounts for this counterexample is by saying you
    must always have the same method for coming to know something in
    both cases.
-   Relativizing to methods is a richer and more accurate way of
    thinking about it because you want to keep some variables constant.
-   I do not think that in lottery cases you can assert that your ticket
    will lose because you are presented with a precision of facts do not
    exist in other belief cases. *Knowledge and Lotteries*, book, read.

-   Virtues:
    1.  Explains many Gettier cases.
    2.  Explains you can "never know" if your ticket is a loser.
    3.  Explains skeptics worries and yields the right response.

### Nozick and sensitivity

-   Nozick came up with the sensitivity argument.
-   He noticed that it entailed it that closure is false.
-   Being clever, he also realized he could use it to respond to the
    skeptic.
    -   This meant that it was a virtue and not a vice.

-   If you wanted to motivate sensitivity on it's own, there's a lot you
    can do.
    -   Very often, we want sensitivity.
    -   If your beliefs were false and you'd still hold them, that'd be
        a problem.

### Safety

-   We can imagine easily a world where a common scenario is found in a
    dream, making you wrong, a wrong belief.
    -   So dreams *have to be* fake.

-   Well you wake up a realize it was a wrong belief.
    -   The person in fake barn country could learn more about their
        enviroment, and realize that they weren't looking at a barn or
        that they weren't allowed to use their assumption about the barn

-   "Retrospective knowledge" is dangerous.
-   Is this similar to the defeater problem?
    -   The simpler thing to say is that we can still evaluate the prior
        time slice, while they later went on to reform their beliefs, in
        the moment they didn't know.

#### An aside <small>Helpful Wishful Thinking</small>

-   There are some cases where a worry similar to circular reasoning
    arising.
-   Safety was proposed as a necessary condition on knowledge.
    -   What do you have to add to JTB to get knowledge?
    -   If you pursue safety for this, you get to avoid the helpful
        wishful thinking.

### Truth fairy

-   Devastating for necessary truth.
-   There is something behind the circular reasoning thought.

### Virtue epistemology

-   The more general pattern of evaluation is the AAA pattern.
-   On an analogy about archers,
    -   If it hit the bull's-eye, it is **accurate**.
    -   If it manifest the archer's competence, it is **adroit**.
    -   If the success of a shot was a manifestation of the archer's
        competence, it is **apt**.

-   The nice thing about Sosa's picture is that it allows us to
    understand Gettier cases as a specific instance of a failure of
    aptness.

### First order and second order seperation motivation

-   We don't need a criterion of truth to act.
    -   Does this mean you can act on belief?

-   From an abstract point of view, it is better to act on knowledge
    rather than abstract belief.
