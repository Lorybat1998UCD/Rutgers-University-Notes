# Leibniz <small>with Professor Martha Bolton</small>

## Syllabus 

### Texts 

Assigned and recommended readings will be papers, letters, and published articles of Leibniz, as well as some secondary sources. Readings will be on electronic reserve although there will also be class handouts. Many of the readings are taken from a collection of writings of Leibniz which is available at the bookstore, G. W. Leibniz, Philosophical Essays, tr. Roger Ariew and Daniel Garber. Purchase is optional; all assigned readings will be available electronically.

### Requirements  

You are expected to attend all meetings of the class and to do all reading assignments thoroughly and promptly. Assignments should be read at least once for the class meeting in which they are to be discussed. You are strongly encouraged to participate in class discussion. This helps you and everyone in the class to learn by exploring them yourself. There will be one short paper (roughly 5 pages) assigned during the semester and a long paper (roughly 12-15 pages) due at the end of course. There may be additional out-of-class written assignments, quizzes, or in-class exercises.

### Learning goals 

The course is intended to provide a good understanding of some of the central doctrines of Leibniz's metaphysics and theory of cognition, the reasoning by which we supports them, their strengths and weakness, historical context and significance. It is also meant to develop skill in analyzing and evaluating arguments, as well as developing, supporting, and expressing views of one's own.

## January 23rd, 2013 - Lecture: The alphabet of thought and method of demonstrating truths

- Leibniz lived between 1646 to 1716
- In the part of the world we now call Germany, there was terrible religious war and plague.
- Public debates were held where the public tried to decide which was "the religion."
- The people who were Calvinist may have had comfort or distress based on radical predetermination.
	+ The idea, starkly, is if you're saved, you don't worry about.
	+ Conversely, in the Roman Catholic religion, works are important.
	+ This is one brand of Protestantism, and it was stark and hard to live with.
	+ There are lot of religious debates over this.
- There was a flourishing of counter-Reformation art, commissioned by the church.
- There are a lot of treatises on self-help and logic, critical thinking.
- This was a counter-Reformation strategy, these self-help manuals.
- This has to do with the social contract theory.
- The Eighteenth Century is what we called the "Enlightenment Era", and Leibniz bridges the past and the Enlightenment.
- Leibniz's life
	+ His father was a university professor.
	+ This father instilled a love of learning in him.
	+ Yet, Leibniz was largely self-taught. He taught himself Latin at the age of 7.
	+ Leibniz is the co-discoverer of infinitesimal calculus and a logician.
	+ He is extremely interested in formal structures, languages and symbol systems
	+ He constructed a wooden calculating machine that you could "turn."
	+ He was very good at seeing abstract "relations" between things.
	+ He first adopted the views of the scholastics, of Aquinas and Aristotle.
		* Aquinas adopts Aristotle to apply it to Roman Catholiscism.
	+ When 16 years old, he replaces Aristotelian system with mechanism.
		* Mechanism is the view that everything that happens in the corporeal world is just matter in motion.
		* This means matter can be represented in geometry.
		* The hope is that motion can be represented in mathematical formulas.
	+ Leibniz starts out just accepting Aristotelianism, and ends up converting to mechanism.
	+ German was a collection of principalities with princes who trade with one another.
	+ His teachers recognize his brilliance, and offer him a job, but he declines it and goes into public office.
	+ He was sent to Paris on a diplomatic mission. This was a revolution for Leibniz.
	+ He learns mathematics from Cartesians and he reads about Galileo and Hougins (pendular motion).
	+ He comes alive intellectually here in this "Paris period" (1672-1676), and he was eventually called back.
	+ This laid the foundations for his philosophy and his mathematics and his motions, all formulated here.
	+ He was working on what he calls the "foundation of cognition."
	+ Career
		* He goes back to England speaks with Spinoza (exiled Jewish naturalist), Oldenburg
		* Goes back to Germany and settles in Hanover.
		* He has a variety of employers in and around the court.
		* Engineering projects, diplomatic projects.
		* He came up with the idea of distracting France by pointing out Egypt.
		* He is the court historian.
		* He comes up with a geological history of his region.
		* One thing for which he is famous is that he was working with the ancestors of George Ludwig, and he discovers that languages change.
		* While he is doing this research, he finds documents that establish a connection between George Ludwig and the British monarchy.
		* When the Brits ran out of monarchs, this made Ludwig become George the First of England.
	+ Aside from his career, he had private projects.
	+ He wanted to reconcile Protestantism with Catholicism.
	+ He is very interested in codes and code-breaking (with Wallace).
	+ Interested in physics, theology - Jesuits, protestants, - many other things.
	+ He is intellectually engaged in almost everything that is going on.
- Leibniz's thoughts
	+ Cognition
		+ Humans and animals both participate in cognition, but humans also participate in knowledge.
		+ Prof. Bolton doesn't believe that her cat has beliefs, and that if her cat does, the cat is unwarranted in holding the,
			* Well, she does, but only because she's so fond of her cat.
		+ How does what goes on in a mind or a soul, a cognitive being, sense perception, related to its environment, so that there is actual intaking of information? Not just atoms.
		+ We also have information about what is, what could be, what might be, what ought be, what is necessarily true, etc.
		+ There is "mind-world" and "super world" cognition.
		+ He comes up with the thought that we think of many things that are complex, but if we think of complex things, there must be simple things that they are made of.
		+ Our thoughts must be composed of simple thoughts.
		+ What are the simples? If you could only find the simples, you'd have a powerful instrument.
		+ He has this vision that there is an alphabet of human thought.
		+ He becomes discouraged, but he has plenty of projects trying to find it.
	+ Classical metaphysical thoughts
		+ Is there anything that remains? Stays the same?
		+ If god exists, then god remains.
	+ The mains philosophical works are:
		1. *Meditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas* (1684)
		2. *Discourse on Metaphysics* (1686)
		3. *Specimen of Dynamics* (1695)
		4. 'New System of the nature and Communications of Substances'

## January 28th, 2013 - Reading
### Leibniz's 'Of an Oragnum or Ars Magna of Thinking' (1679)

- The supreme happiness is the greatest increase in one's own perfection.
- Vigor shares the same relationship over health as disease is under health.
- The most powerful human faculty is thinking.
	+ Assisted by either remedies of body or mind.
- Remedies of bodies are applied to corporeal organs directly.
- Remedies of mind are those modes of thinking that make other thoughts easier.
- The greatest remedy of mind is the modes of thinking which infinite others arise - like the numbers 1 through 10 can generate all other numbers.
- Thoughts must be "built on" something - there must be a point where you have "the most simple" thought(s).
- Another example is that all numbers can be built on using everything and nothing, 0 and 1, using the binary system. 

### Leibniz's 'Preface to Universal Characteristic' (1678-9)

- God made all using weight, measure, and number. Mechanism.
- Those things that cannot be weighed because they have no force or power.
- Also things that "lack parts," and thus cannot be measured.
- There is nothing that can't be numbered, however. This is how everything is investigated.
- Since Pythagoras, people have thought there to be mystery in numbers.
- Because they lacked understanding, they slipped into superstition and futility.
- This nonsense still fills books, and also, the belief that numbers can discover amazing things remains.
- The Universal Characteristic is a language in which "all notions and things are nicely ordered."
- Yet no one has discovered a language which does what numbers do.
- When he was young, Leibniz saw that no one could devise a certain alphabet of human thoughts.
- Leibniz spends quite a while calling other people stupid for not having thought of this because he did it when he was a youth.
- When the characteristic numbers of notions is determined, it will do for the mind what glasses did for the eyes.

> When we have a true characteristic number of things, then at last, without any mental effort or danger of error, we will be able to judge whether arguments are indeed materially sound and draw the right conclusions.

### Leibniz's 'Samples of the Numerical Characteristic' (1679)

- Observes that while sometimes an argument leads to the correct conclusion, it is not because of sound argument or true premises.
- Every categorical proposition has two times: the subject and the predicate.
- The quality of the proposition is affirmation or negation.
- The quantity of the proposition is universality or particularity.
- In every proposition, the predicate is said to be in the subjection.
- For example, "Every man is an animal" means "The concept of animal is contained in the concept of man."
- Leibniz does some weird and goofy number assignment and negative stuff here.

## January 28th, 2013 - Lecture

- Remember that Leibniz escapes from nothern Germany to Paris, and he is called back to Germany to write 'Of an Organum or Ars of Thinking.'
- He's interested in what can be done for personal happines and the happiness of society in general.
- He's thinking that improving our power of thinking would go a  long way to improve happines.
- He's thinking that if you can take the "smallest" truth and use it to build other truths, it would be more efficient.
- So he comes up with this argument - either you can see this thing, or you can see this thing through something else.
- What's the distinction between: 
	1. concieving of something and
	2. concieving of something through another "thing"
- If you want to concieve an even number, you concieve of a number through something else, the specific type of number it is.
	+ You think of a number,
	+ And of a number divisible by two.
- Suppose I think of a triangle, do I think solely of a triangle or do I think of it through another concept.
- The concept of an odd number is that of a number and of a number not divisible by two.
- To be precise, concept A (involves, includes, contains) concept B.
- Leibniz is thinking that if you cannot concieve of justice without virtue, this is relevant.
- He's got an argument that since we concieve some things through other things, there has to be concepts which are ultimately simple, that they aren't built from others, that they are independant conceptions.
- From these basics, we can build the comples.
- How does he show that there are these simple concepts?
- Leibniz is thinking that you can always ask whether a concept is "simple" or "complex."
- If nothing is concieved as itself, nothing can be concieved at all.
- You cannot think of a compound concept without actually thinking about the sum of it's parts.
- A point about Leibniz's argument:
	+ Could it be that there are complex concepts, but that they come in "familys."
	+ That any member of any given family could be used to build another, forming a "circularity."
	+ For instance:
		* A point is simple.
		* A line is motion of a point.
		* A plane is the motion of a line.
	+ And additionally:
		* A plane is simple.
		* A line is the intersection of two planes.
		* A point is the intersection of two lines.
	+ This is the distinction between "wholists" and "atomists."
- Leibniz thought that maybe the only thing "concieved throught itself" is god.
- One of his thoughts is that everything is composed of limits on the infinite.
	+ He never fully sketched this idea out.
	+ He was "attracted" to this idea.
- Leibniz is thinking that is you have the simple concepts and you assign them "symbols", then, just by mechanically generating all the allowable symbols, you could generate all the concepts.
- So Leibniz has the idea that given symbols of all concepts, you would have the symbols to generate all propositions, and you'll be able to determine whether the propositions were true.
- He has this thought of forming an artificial languages. 
- The concept containment theory of truth
	+ He is making assumptions about propositions.
	+ Aristotle's logic is that there are basic propositions which build all other propositions. There are four:
		1. All A is B ⇔ the concept of A contains the concept of B.
		2. No A is B ⇔ the concept of A contains the concept of not B.
		3. Some A is B ⇔ the concept of A and the some concept of something X contains the concept of B.
		4. Some A is not B ⇔ the concept of A + X contains the conceopt of not B.
		
> In every true proposition the concept of the predicate is somehow contained in the concept of the subject.

- Anything that satisfies the subject satisfies the predicate.

## January 30th, 2013 - Reading

### Leibniz's 'That a Most Perfect Being Exists' (1676)

- Simple concepts are perfect forms and they are impossible to access.
- Only "universal propositions" can be stated about that which cannot be demonstrated.
- "Necessary identical propositions are identical."
	+ An indentical proposition is something akin to "A is A."
- As many simple forms as you want can exist in the same subject.
- Existence is one of these simple forms, one of the perfections.
- Therefore, a most perfect being must exist. 
	+ Q.E.D. stands for "quod erat demonstrandum", which means "which had to be demonstrated."
- An argument:
	+ What is necessary, necessarilly exists. 
	+ Whatever necessarilly exists, exists.
	+ Therefore, a necessary being exists.

#### [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Leibniz: The Existence of God](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/#ExiGod)

- Leibniz thinks that perfection is a "simple quality which is positive and absolute, or, which expresses without any limits whatever it does express."
- From this, it follows that "there can be no inconsistency among perfections, since a perfection, in being simple and positive, is unanalyzable and incapable of being enclosed by limits."
- Compounding any and all simple truths will never be incompatible.
- Therefore, it is possible that all simples are compatible.
- This argument is not sufficient to demonstrate that god necessarilly exists.

## January 30th, 2013 - Lecture: Method of demonstration and the existence of God

- There are two things: things you think of through others and things you think of through itself.
- There has to be simple concepts, otherwise we couldn't think of anything.
- You can't think a thought of something without "bottoming out" on a simple concept eventually.
- By relating simple concepts, you get all other concepts that there are.
- Then, a proposition is made out of concepts.
- All basic propositions are "subject/predicate" propositions, joined by "is" and "is not."
- All other propositions can be formed from basic propositions.
- They are all universal, negative, existential, affirmitive.
- We can get all basic propositions from the alphabet of human thought.
- When you have subject concept and predicate concept, decompose the two, and you'll find that every concept in the subject is in the predicate, the "simple concepts" that for the two concepts will be identical.
	+ Is everything that is true "vacuously true"?
		* No - because every simple concept is ground in god. 
- Leibniz is thinking that the connection between "Every A is B" is loose enough that facts about the world are possible.
- Leibniz is worried about this problem, this is a preface, an anticpation.
- If you grant "simple concepts", all of the above follows.

### Leibniz's 'That a Most Perfect Being Exists' (1676)

- Ontological argument
- Subject to a lot of objections
- Anselm and Leibniz, revived by Descartes
- Leibniz grants what a lot of critics deny: that existence is an attribute.
- Existence, for Leibniz, is something that is ascribed to a thing (as opposed to presupposed when you prescribe anything else).
- He does not grant that existence is perfection.
- Necessary existence is different from mere existence, it is eternally unshakable.
- It's quite an extraordinary way of being, and it is a perfection.
- When we form this definition that god is the most perfect being, we put words together, and have concepts.
- You can do this in a way that you don't define anything because of contradiction.
- "A regular 12-sided polygon" - geometrically impossible but "valid" definition.
- When we toss out a definition, we may only be talking formally, but you're talking nonsense.
- In "Ars Magna", the second part, he says we can't trace back the "simples" all the way, but we can get far enough.
- We've got to halt and no reason on the basis of some definition.
- If this definition of god is something that's possible, it shows that it exists.
- He undertakes showing that is possible that a necessary being exists.
- He's going to use the apparatus of the concept containment of truth.
- This is very abstract.
- Argument:
	1. Perfections are undefinable or have concepts that are unanalyzable.
		* The first thing is: he defines perfection as absolute positive quality.
		* Also indefinable and unanalyzable.
		* Once you have the notion of unlimited extension, you can specify parts of it.
		* There are endless ways of specifying an unlimited concept, but when you do, you are inevitable limiting it.
		* All perfections are limitless attributes, no limitation built-in to them.
		* By virtue of this, they are simple.
		* If you've got a proposition about a perfection, the subject is unalazable, it is "immune" to demonstration.
	2. A necessarilly true proposition that is indemonstrable is an indentity.
		* If you've got an indemonstrable proposition that is necessarilly true, it's got to be that the subject concept has to be in the predicate concept.
		* Every A is AB
	3. Suppose it's not possible that A and B are perfections and that A and B belong to the same thing.
		* Let's consider this supposition as expressed by the following: "A is B-incompatible."
		* This is not an identity.
		* It's undefinable, unalazable.
		* Can't be demonstrated.
		* But a necessarilly true proposition is an identity, so this isn't a necessary truth.
	4. "A is B-incompatible" is not an identity and not demonstrable. So it's not necesarilly true.
		* This also works with "A is B-compatible." This seems to break the argument?
		* All Leibniz wants to show is that it's not impossible.
		* So "A is B-incompatible" is possible true.
- Homework: Use Leibnizian logic to prove:
	- All cockerspaniels are dogs.
	- All triangles have three angels.
	- Water is liquid at room temperature.

## February 4th, 2013 - Reading

### Homework

- All cockerspaniels are dogs.
	+ Subject: cocker spaniels
	+ Predicate: all are dogs.
	+ "In every true proposition the concept of the predicate is somehow contained in the concept of the subject."
	+ Cockerspaniels are a complex idea experienced through the concept of dog, along with the other properties of cockerspaniels.
	+ Symbolically, cockerspaniels can be represented as {\\( \mathrm{dog}, q_1, q_2, … , q_n \\)} where qs are qualities unique to cockerspaniels and "dog" is the set of all concepts in dog.
	+ The concept of dog is a complex idea experienced through other ideas, but it does not need to be defined here. Let {dog} be the set of all dog qualities.
	+ Because {dog} \\( \in \\) {\\( \mathrm{dog}, q_1, q_2, … , q_n \\)}, all cocker spaniels are dogs.
- All triangles have three angles.
	+ Triangle's are complex ideas experienced through: {shape, polygon, three angles, three edges, …}
	+ {three angles} \\(\in\\) {shape, polygon, three angles, three edges, …}
	+ So \\( \forall x \\) if x is a triangle \\( \to \\) x has three angles
- Water is liquid at room temperature
	+ We experience water through the simpler concepts of: {chemical compound, 2 hydrogen 1 oxygen}
	+ You cannot prove this with Leibnizian logic because you need causation.
	+ The concept of liquid is not "contained within" the concept of water.

### Leibniz's 'On Contingency' (1686?)

- Existence does not differ from essence for god.
- It is essential for god to exist.
- God is a necessary being.
- Creatures are contingent in that their existence does not follow from their essence.
	+ This is what it must be to be mortal.
	+ Leibniz think that god's essence \\( \to \\) god's being.
- Necessary truths are those that can be demonstrated through analysis of terms.
	+ This is "Leibnizian logic" - see cocker spaniels exercise.
	+ Example: An equation expressing an identity ultimately results from substitution of terms.
	+ "Everything true is an identity"
- We does say that both god and creatures exist.
- Necessary propositions are no less true than contingent ones.
- One can always give a reason for every non-identical proposition.
	+ In necessary propositions, reason necessitates.
	+ In contingent propositions, it inclines.
- Of things that exist, they have more "reason to exist" that things which do not exist.
- In contingent propositions, there comes a point where only god can further understand the infinite analysis.
- One can ask whether this proposition is necessary: Nothing exists without there being a greater reason for it to exist that for it to not.
- Not all possibles attain existence, otherwise nothing novel could be imagined, yet they obviously can be.
- There are an infinite number of series of possible things, and one series cannot be contained within another. Therefore:
	1. God always acts with the mark of perfection and wisdom.
	2. Not every possible thing attains existence.
- "The proposition that has the greater reason for existing exists."
	+ Existing means "being true."
	+ Exists means "is true"
	+ This proposition is necessarily true.

## February 4th, 2013 - Lecture: The infinite analysis theory of contingent truth

- Even without the proof of the possibility of god, the argument discussed last time has some "moral weight."
- It's not valueless, even if nobody has proved the possibility of a being with all perfections.
- While we're waiting, people should work on trying to prove the possibility of god, and Leibniz thinks he has.
- "We're entitled to assume the possibility of any being until someone shows the contrary."
- If something exists rather than nothing, something is possible.
- We ought to have a bias in favor of the possible because of reality.
- He often remarks with regards to Euclid that it was the closest to science in the 17th century, that he couldn't prove that a line was the shortest distance between two points.
- Leibniz is just barely out of university when he wrote what we're reading.
- They're also unpublished.
- These are comparable to the false start in papers.
- One of the things that the professor likes about reading Leibniz's early work is that you can try to figure out how his mind is working and how he forming and revising his opinions.
- Towards this end, homework.
	+ Triangle
		* The concepts which we have through names, lexical ones, are very complex.
		* Relative to the alphabet of human thought, that is.
		* There are lots of ways of decomposing the analysis of the whole thing, triangle.
		* This depends on how many "simples" there are in the concept.
		* Leibniz remarks on this from time to time.
		* When he talks about a definition or an analysis, he is thinking about something that is coextensive with it.
	+ Water
		* You have to engage in an analysis of water.
		* Can we go outside on what we know just on the basic of concepts.
- Leibnizz thinks we need to proceed by analyzing terms, and if we're doing this in the English language, we're using definitions.
- We are trying to do these analyses in English, and Leibniz is well aware that it is not a perfect language, for that reason, if we try to use English, we'll run into problems.
- To actually implement of proof that Leibniz calls demonstration, we would really need an ideal language.
- The more logical and precise your language, the further you can get with these proofs.
- There are these "hitches" and "things to take into account" given our knowledge.
- He continues to use this as the standard of demonstration.
- When he talks about demonstration, he is talking about a high gauge notion which irrecvibly shows something.
- There are arguments which aren't demonstration that are still valuable.
- You have to start from where you are, and you're not an ideal point, you'll have to use arguments which aren't solid.
- But keep track of your assumptions and check them - this is how you make progress.

### Leibniz's 'On the Nature of Truth' (1686)

- This is later than the Paris period, and he's still thinking his way through the concept cointainment theory of truth.
- There are three illustrations of Leibniz's difficulties.
- He's trying to figure out how to make it work.
- He starts out by saying every proposition is either true or false, but not both.
- There is no proposition that is indeterminate.
- If a proposition p is false, then the contradictory of p is true. \\( p \\) and \\(\lnot p \\) are contradictory.
	+ Law of non-contradiction
	+ Interestingly, this law cannot be proved, because you'd have to use propositions.
- A true proposition is one which the concept of the predicate is contained the concept of the subject, meaing there is a connection, and it is objective, built into reality.
- This containment can be express or virtual, which means in the context "potential."
- This connection is either necessary of contigent.
	+ Necessary if it follows from definitions and consequences.
	+ Contigent if different things are true at different times. (This is only one kind)
		* Also, it's not necessarily true or false, it's a propositions that's possibly true or false, but happens to be true.
		* The impossibility of that thing is not necesarilly true.
		* They vary in time.
		* There is no necessary connection.
		* We assume they follow from free decress of god.
		* Always have to do with things that exist, are natural, about things that do exist other than god and the assumption is that they exist because god wills that they exist.
	+ The principle of sufficient reason: For every true proposition, there is a reason for it being true rather than otherwise.
		* Nothing happens which a reason cannot be given for it happening rather than otherwise.
		* No proposition is true without there being a reason.

### Principle of Sufficient Reason

#### [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_sufficient_reason)

The principle of sufficient reason states that nothing is without a ground or reason why it is.

* For every entity *x*, if *x* exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why *x* exists.
* For every event *e*, if *e* occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why *e* occurs.
* For every proposition *p*, if *p* is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why *p* is true.

> We have said that the concept of an individual substance [Leibniz also uses the term haecceity ] includes once for all everything which can ever happen to it and that in considering this concept one will be able to see everything which can truly be said concerning the individual, just as we are able to see in the nature of a circle all the properties which can be derived from it. But does it not seem that in this way the difference between contingent and necessary truths will be destroyed, that there will be no place for human liberty, and that an absolute fatality will rule as well over all our actions as over all the rest of the events of the world? To this I reply that a distinction must be made between that which is certain and that which is necessary.

#### [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/)

> The principle of sufficient reason, namely, that nothing happens without a reason. 

- all truths rest upon two great principles: 
	1. the Principle of Contradiction (which says that a truth is necessary just in case its negation is a contradiction) 
	2. and the PSR

### Leibniz's 'On Freedom' (1689?)

- How freedom and contingency can coexist is one of the oldest human worries.
- The worry is increased when you add Christianity to the affair.
- When Leibniz considered that nothing happened by chance, he was close to the view that everything was absolutely necessary.
- Some think that it's enough to be un-coerced, even if we're subject to necessity.
- There are certain possibilities that will never be.
- There are fictions that have no place is this universal series god selected.
	+ Unless the universe contains everything.
	+ This would eliminate all beauty.
- All creatures have impressed upon them a certain mark of divine infinity.
- There is no portion of matter so tiny that it does not contain a sort of world of creatures of infinite number.
- Even though in contingent truths, the predicate is in the subject, it can never be demonstrated as an equality or identity.
	+ God alone can see it though.
	+ This is derived from his intellect.
- Two ways remains for us to know continent truths:
	1. Experience: when we perceive a thing sufficiently distinly through the sense.
	2. Reason: when something is know from the general principle that nothing is without a reason, or that there is always some reason why the predicate is in the subject.
- God made everything in the most perfect way, an he does nothing without a reason, and nothing happens anywhere unless he who understands understands its reasons.
- God knowns infinite and contigent truths not by demonstrastion, as this would imply contradiction, but rather by divine intuition.
	+ This intution is not experiential, but rather one of *a priori*.
- Having accepted the notion that necessity everyone accepts, which is that those things whose contrary implies a contradiction.

### Leibniz's 'Primary Truths' (1689)

- The primary truths are those which assert the same thing of itself or deny the opposite of its opposite.
	+ A is A
	+ Not-A is not-A
	+ "Everything is as it is."
	+ "Everything is similar or equal to itself."
	+ "Nothing is greater or less than itself."
- All remaining truths are reducded to primary truths with the help of definitions.
	+ Through resolution of other notions.
	+ A proof indepedant of experience.
	+ "The whole is greater than its part."
	+ "The part is less than the whole."
	+ Something esaily demostrated from the definition of less or greater.
		+ Arguement:
		1. The part is equal to a part of the whole.
		2. What is equal to a part of a whole is less than the whole.
		3. Therefore, the part is less than the whole.
- Therefore the predicate is always in the subject.
- This is truth for every affirmitive truth, universal or particular, necessary or contigent.
- Things that follow from this:
	+ Nothing is without reasons.
	+ There is no effect without cause.
	+ When in the givens everything on one side is the same as the other side.
	+ There is even a reason for eternal things.
	+ There cannot be two individual things that differ in number alone.
	+ There are no purely extrinsic demominations.
	+ Every individual substance contains in its perfect notion the entire universe.
	+ All individual created substances are different expressions of the same universe.
	+ No created substance exerts a metaphysical action or influx on any other thing.
	+ Assuming the distinction between soul and body allows us to explain their union.
	+ There is no vacuum.
	+ There is no atom.
	+ Every particle of the unverse contains a world of an infitiy of creatures.
	+ There is no determinate shape in actual things.
	+ Corporeal substance can neither arise nor perish except through creation or annihilation.
	+ Animate things neither arise nor perish, but are only transformed.
	
## February 6th, 2013 - Lecture: More consequences of the 'predicate in notion' theory of truth

- The infinite analysis will always yield a reason a true proposition is true.
- We have the principle of sufficient reason.
- A couple of questions:
	1. Whether the PSR has a sufficient reason.
		+ There's a kind of reason for thinking there is a reason for the PSR.
		+ It's a truth, Leibniz says.
		+ All truths have SR.
		+ So what's the SR for the PSR?
		+ God does nothing without a reason?
		+ If it is contigent, god could have created the PSR false.
		+ But surely it's necessary. 
		+ If you grant the concept containment theory of truth, then you have to analyze the terms.
	2. How you'll bring together the PSR, god creates the world, how the PSR governs god, and how a lot of things are contigently true.
- Leibniz attempts to clean up his PSR by distinguishing existence and propositions.
- The thing is that "*x* exists* is a proposition.
- Leibniz wants to say:
	1. God exists essentially-necessarily.
	2. Creatures exist contigently.
	3. There are truths that are necessary.
	4. There are truths that are contigent.
- But what are common between necessary and contingent beings and necessary and contigent truths?
- Two questions come up:
	1. Is it necessary for god to choose the best?
		+ The best of the alternatives.
		+ The greater of the opposite.
	2. Is it necessary that nothing exists without there being a greater reason for it to exist than not?
		+ The only reason that will appeal to an infinitely powerful and knowing agent is that one of the possible alternatives is the best.
		+ Here's a problem: Adam exists. Adam sins. God created this. How does is this resolved?
		+ Everything for Leibniz, nothing is isolated in it existence.
		+ Leibniz will fill this in in the material world, with the fact that matter is infnitely divisable and extenable.
		+ One motion has material consequences for everything else in the world.
		+ Everything in the world is also influenced by everything in the world.
		+ If you want a full account of why someone sneezes, you have to describe the whole universe.
		+ The things that are present in material things that are diversified infinitely.
- The necessity of the consequence does not determine the necessity of the consequent.
- If Zero Dark Thirty won the Oscar, it got the most number of votes. If it wins, it is necessary it does. But it's not necessary it does.

### Leibniz's 'On Freedom'

+ One of the reasons Leibniz is so interested in matters of fact being contigent in the actual world is that he wants to preserve accountability.
+ He wants to preserve freedom.
- What counts as freedom?

### Definitions
+ **Concept Containment Theory of Truth**: In every true proposition, the concept of the predicate is contained in the concept of the subject, either the analysis is finite or inifite, but in either case the connection between concepts is the reason for the propositions truth.
+ **Principle of Sufficient Reason**: For every true proposition there is a reason for it, being true rather than false.

### 'Discourse on Metaphysics' (1686)

#### 1. On Divine Perfection, and That God Does Everything in the Most Desirable Way

- God is an absolutely perfect being
	+ This is the best way we can describe god
	+ We also need to consider what it actually means.
	+ There are several different perfections in nature.
		* God possesses them all together.
- What is a perfection?
	+ Things that are not capable of a highest degree are *not* perfections.
	+ The "greatest of all number/figures" imply a contradiction, so not perfection.
	+ On the otherhand, knowledge has "all knowledge", so it's a perfection,
	+ Power and knowledge are perfections, insofar as they belong to god.
- God:
	1. Posseses infinite and supreme wisdom
	2. Acts in the perfect manner in:
		* Metaphysical matters,
		* Moral matters

#### 2. Against Those Who Claim That There Is No Goodness in God's Work, or That the Rules of Goodness and Beauty Are Arbitrary

- Leibniz is far removed from those who maintain there is no good or perfect
	+ It can't be so because god is their author, would have considered them afterwards, and found them good.
	+ Scriptures are an anthropomorphic expression only to make understand the excellence of god'd work.
	+ Through considering the works you can discover the creator.
		* Therefore, his works carry his mark
		* The contrary opinion is dangerous
	+ In saying that things are not good by virtue of any rule of goodness but by the whim of god, you destroy god's love and glory.
	+ Where will his power remain if it is simply despotic?
		* Besides, all acts presuppose a reason for willing.
	+ Descartes thought that god "could have" willed that a triangle have four sides.

#### 3. Against Those Who Believe That God Might Have Made Things Better

- Nor can Leibniz approve of those who maintain that god could have made the world better.
	+ The consequences of this opinion is contrary to the glory of god.
		* A lesser evil is relatively good
		* A lesser good is relatively evil
	+ Showing that an architect could have done better is to find fault with his work.
	+ If their right, the "the series of imperfection descends to infinity"
		* This view is backed by scripture
	+ Leibniz thinks that there is nothing so perfect that there is not something more perfect.
- In this way way, the "moderns" believe that they can safeguard god's freedom.
	+ To think that god does something without having a reason does not conform to his glory.
	+ Imagine god has a choice between *A* or *B*, chooses *A*, without considering *B*.
		* Being as all praise must be based on some reason, this is absurd.
	+ God does nothing for which he does not deserve to be praised.

#### 4. That the Love of God Requires Our Complete Satisfaction and Acquiescence with Respect to What He Has Done without Our Being Quietists as a Result

- The genral knowlege of this truth is the foundation of the love that we owe god
	+ He who loves seeks his satisfaction of the object loved and in his actions.
	+ It is difficult to love god when we are not disposed to will what god wills.
	+ Those who are not satisfied with god are not much different from rebels.
- To act in accordance to god, it is not sufficient to be patient.
	+ We must be satisfied with everything that comes according to his will.
	+ We must not:
		1. Be quietists
		2. Stand ridiculously with arms folded
	+ We must:
		1. Act in accordance with what we presume to be the will of god
		2. Contribute to the general good

#### 5. What the Rules of the Perfection of Divine Conduct Consist in, and That the Simplicity of the Ways Is in Balance with the Richness of the Effects

- Therefore it is sufficient to have the confidence that god does everthing for the best.
	+ To know in detail the reasons that could have moved him surpasses the power of the mind.
- However, it is possible to make general remarks
	+ He who acts perfectly is similar to an excellent geometer.
	+ The most perfect of all beings occupies the least volume that least interfere with one another.
- On the simplicity of the ways of god
	+ Nothing costs god anything
	+ Since god only has to make decrees in order that a real world come into being
	+ The simplest system is always preferred in astronomy.

#### 6. God Does Nothing Which Is Not Orderly and It Is Not Even Possible to Imagine Events That Are Not Regular

- The volitions or acts of god are divided into two groups:
	1. Ordinary
	2. Extraordinary
		* The extraordinary is only extraordinary relative to god to those creatures who have seen an established order
- In whatever manner god created the world, it would have been regular an in accordance with certain general order.
	+ God chose the most perfect world.
		* In that it is simplest in hypotheses and richest in phenomena
		* Just like a line in geometry whose construction is easy and whose properties and effects are remarkable and widespread.

#### 7. That Miracles Conform to the General Order, Even Though They May Be Contrary to the Subordinate Maxims; and about What God Wills or Permits by a General or Particular Volition

- Nothing happens which is not in order.
	+ Miracles are therefore part of that natural order.
	+ There are the same type of operation as the subordinate maxims we call the nature of things.
	+ God can have as much a reason to break these maxims as the make the maxims maxims.
- General and particular volitions
	+ God does everything following his most general will.
		* This is in conformiaty with the most perfect order
	+ But he can also have particular volitions
		* These can be exceptions to his general will
	+ The most general are without exception, as they are most within his will.
- God wills everything that is a particular object of his volition
	+ Objects of his general volition are the acts of other creates
	+ If the action is good in itself, we can say that god *wills it* and *sometimes commands it*.
		* Even if it doesn't take place.
	+ If the action is evil in itself and becomes good only by accident, then we can say that god *permits* it.
		* But he does not *will* it.
	+ He concurs with it because of the laws of nature he has established and because he knows how to draw greater good from it.
	

#### 8. To Distinguish the Actions of God from Those of Creatures We Explain the Notion of an Individual Substance

- It is difficult to distinguish the actions of god and creatures
	+ Some believe god does everything.
	+ Some believe god does only what is needed to conserve the energy of creatures.
- When there are several predicates associated with a subject and the subject is attributed to no other, it is called an *individual substance*.
	+ We must considering what it is to attributed truly to a certain subject.
- Every true predication has some basis in the nature of things.
	+ When the predicate is not contained in the subject, it must be contained virtually.
	+ The subject term must alwayus contain the predicate term.

> The notion of an individual substance or of a complete being is to have a notion so completel that is is sufficient to contain and to allow us to deduce from it all the predicates of the subject to which this notion is attributed.

- The quality of being a kind is not enough to determine enough to constitue an individual, nor is it a quality that anything is exclusively.
	+ But when god sees Alexander the Great, he sees the basis and reason for all predicates.
	+ He knows *a priori* what will happen to him and what did and what is.
	+ When we considering the connection of things, we can say that Alexander's soul contains vestiges of everything that has happened to him and marks everyhing that will happen to him and even marks of everything that will happen in the universe.
	
#### 9. That Each Singular Substance Expresses the Whole Universe in Its Own Way, and That All Its Events, Together with All Their Circumstances and the Whole Sequence of External Things, Are Included in Its Notion

#### 10. That the Belief in Substantial Forms Has Some Basis, but That These Forms Do Not Change Anything in the Phenomena and Must Not Be Used to Explain Particular Effects

#### 11. That the Thoughts of the Theologians and Philosophers Who Are Called Scholastics Are Not Entirely to Be Disdained

#### 12. That the Notions Involved in Extension Contain Something Imaginary and Cannot Constitute the Substance of Body

#### 13. Since the Individual Notion of Each Person Includes Once and for All Everything That Will Even Happen to Him, One Sees in It the *A Priori* Proofs of the Truth of Each Event, or, Why One Happened Rather Than Another. But These Truths, However Certain, Are Nevertheless Contingent, Being Based on the Free Will of God or of His Creatures, Whose Choice Always Has Its Reasons, Which Incline without Necessitating.

#### 14. God Produces Various Substances According to the Different Views He Has of the Universe, and through God's Intervention the Proper Nature of Each Substance Brings It about That What Happens to One Corresponds with What Happens to All Other, without Their Acting upon One Another Directly

#### 15. The Action of One Finite Substance on Another Consists Only in the Increase of Degree of its Expression Together with the Diminution of the Expression of the Other, Insofar as God Requires THem to Accommodate Themselves to One Another

#### 16. God's Extraordinary Concourse Is Included in That Which Our Essence Expresses, for This Expression Extends to Everything. But This Concourse Surpasses the Powers of Our Nature or of Our Distinct Expression, Which Is Finite and Follows Certain Subordinate Maxims

## February 11th, 2013 - Lecture

### Discourse on Metaphysics

- Leibniz starts out in the first four sections laying out basic claims about god.
- First of all, he tells us the way he understands god and what he is.
	+ Absolutely perfection.
- What is perfection?
	+ It is a nature or attribute capable of highest degree.
	+ Movement is not a perfection because there isn't a fastest motion.
	+ Knowledge is a perfection because there is a knowledge of everything.
- God has each of these perfections without limitations.
- He goes on deny theistic voluntarism.
	+ Theistic volutarism about *x* is that god willed that *x*.
- Descartes held the outstanding view that what is true and false is due to the will of god.
	+ If you try to think through this doctrine it is mind boggling.
- He wants to say that the world god created is good not because god willed it to be good but because he created it and it was indepedantly good, in and of itself.
	+ Is the world good because god will the world be good or is the world good because god made a good world?
- Leibniz has an argument based on the PSR that if god were to will that justice be good, it would be, but for a reason, and what better reason than justice actually already being god.
- Two goals:
	1. Maximal diversity of the world
	2. Maximal simplicity of the simples. Leibniz has to create a world where the simple concepts are as intecllectually appealing as possible.
- The divergence of these is perfection.
- There are subordinate laws that generally hold in this true, but no and then there may be exception based on god's will that violates one of these laws.
	+ This violation makes the Universe better than it would be otherwise.
- What does god will when he actually wills that the world exists?
	+ It's delicate because there are bad things.
	+ Does god will bad things?
	+ What should we say about what decrees should exists with regard to the actual world in view of all the bad things?
	+ Leibniz answer:
		* Insofar as god will something in particular volitions, god always wills that these things happen.
		* But about the general laws of nature, there is distinction between what god wills and what he concurs with.
		* To the extent that something is good, he wills it. 
		* To the extent that something is bad, he concurs with it, because the world wouldn't be as good without this one bad.
		* There is nothing god could have done, because he isn't volutarist about the possibles.
		* Questions:
			1. This presupposes that you can get out some good and some bad out of any event, "teasing it out"
			2. Think of god's will. Omnipotent. If she wills it, it happens. If god wills you do something, where is there room for you to be bringing that about? God's will will do it anyway. Anything you do to bring about it, it's going to come about anyway.
		* What god wills is good. So if you know what god wills, you know what's good and will want to do it anyway.
		* **Nicole**: Without access to knowledge of the will of god, so you cannot say that "you did this wrong thing" because of the will of god, because you didn't have access to that.
			1. God is not concerened with freedom or responsibility.
			2. God may still be the one making us want god's will.
		* **Nicole**: There's a possibility of the world being predetermined without a god.
		* For Leibniz, god is sustaining, propping up the world.
		* There are places where Leibniz commits himself to a view that Descartes liked, that once the world exists, there's no guarentee on it continuing. "Existential inertia."
		* To get the world up to this moment is contigent on god continually recreating and willing the world.
		* This makes it more difficult to distinguish the productivity of the world and the productivity of god.
	+ There are two conflicting doctrings:
		1. Continual recreation, and
		2. Continual concurance
	+ Leibniz wants contiual recreation
	+ He also wants to have humans be in a reasonable sense, agents.
	+ Section 8 is about in what sense can god do things and in what sense can creatures do things.
	+ There is a meaningful sense to say two things:
		1. We are agents who choose things.
		2. God is the ultimate agent who chooses everything.
- Aristotle's Categories
	+ A substance is something to which other things are attributed which cannot be attributed to anything else.
		* There are some things are exist in others 
		* Some things are neigther said of nor exist in others.
	+ In the world we have these things, which are referred to as some things, and never referred to as other things.
	+ Leibniz calls this a nominal definition.
		* He worries that we can produce a definition that produces and conceals a contradiction.
	+ Leibniz's project is to show how this model can be contained within the concept containment theory of truth.
	+ "Green is predicated of grass."
	
## February 13th, 2013 - Lecture

- **Concept containment definition of individual substance**: *X* is an individual substance if and only if the concept of *X* contains the basis and reason for everything that can be truly said of *X*.
- 'Discourse on Metaphysics' part 9
	1. **Principle of the Identity of the Indiscernables**: No two substances are exactly alike
		* As far as there properties go, there are no two objects that at every level of granulaity are identical.
		* God would have no reason to create two identicals.
		* Leibniz believes that every proposition contains only concepts.
		* Say that there is a *Y* that is identical to *X*, everything that can be said of *X* can be said of *Y*, except that *X* is not *Y*, but they're identical so this is equivilent to *X* is not *X*, which is a contradiction.
	2. Sunstance begins only by creation and cease to exist only by annihilation
	3. Substance cannot be divided into 2 substances or form by combining 2 substances.
	4. **Mirroring thesis**: Each substance is a mirror of the universe and of god.
	5. Each is bears in some way the character of god, wisdom, and power
		1. Is analogous to god's perception of the infinite
		2. Is such that every other is accomodating it.
		
### Notable paradoxes

- If we know about an individual substance that has a complete concept, then certain things have to be true about everything that satisfy that concept.

## February 18, 2013 - Reading: Excerpts from Leibniz's first two letters to Arnauld (May 1686; 14 July, 1686)

### Remarks on Arnauld's Letter about My Proposition That the Individual Notion of Each Person Includes Once and for All Everything That Will Ever Happen to Him [May 1686]

- Arnauld: god was free to create Adam or not, but assuming that he wanted to create him, everything that has happened to humankind had to happen, or ought to happen, by fatal necessity.
	+ Absolute and hypothetical necessity
	+ Arnauld is speaking only of hypotheical necessity
- The other reply to this is that god is resolving to create Leibniz cannot fail to create a nature capable of thought.
- Arnauld admits in good faith that what can be deduced from the notions of individual is the same process as deducing the notions of a spehere from its properties.

## February 18th, 2013 - Lecture: Fatal necessity and the structure of the concept of an individual substance. 

- Leibniz's points:
	1. When god creates Adam
		* He does it determinately, and absolutely.
		* When god creates Adam, it is part of a whole.
	2. It's one thing to consider truths about kinds of things, it's abstract.
		* Once you get an individual, there's one and only one thing which that concept can apply to.
		* So, Adam, is completely individual and can be inditical to no other.
		* This fits in to Leibniz's view of infinite analysis and identity.
	3. Arnalud: Either the connection Adamn and Adam's posterity is intrinsicdependant of free decrees of god.  Or the connection is intrinsic and necessary. (This bothers him because god would not have a choice.)
		* If god creates Adam and god freely decrees certain laws and freely decrees certain particular events, then Adam's posterity exists.
		* Leibniz stresses the connection between Adam and Adam's posterity, as it is "packed into" Adam.
		* So you just look at the concept
- Adam has a complete concept which contains all the predicates which are true of Adam and everything that happens after he dies, the connection between them contigent laws, but everything is there in the concept.
- Argument, consider Adam-r
	+ There is no reasons to say Adam-r = Adam.
	+ So Adam is not identical to Adam-r
- The original meaning of *a priori* was something you know from it's cause, it was in Leibniz's time which it became known as the "before senses" version.
- **Super-esssentialism**: For all predicates *P*, if *i* is *P*, then necesarilly *i* is *P*.
- **Moderate-essentialism**: For such predicates *P*, if *i* is *P*, then necesarilly *i* is *P* and for some predicates Q, if *i* is Q, necesarilly *i* is Q.
- **Super-intrinsicalism**: If there were a thing *x* which differs in any predicate from *i*, *x* would not be equal to *i*.

## February 20th, 2013 - Lecture: Critique of Descartes' doctrine of corporal substance, substantial forms, corporeal substances

- This was written on the board, on page 85 of the reading. Where a C-body is a cartesian body.
	1. Every C-body is composed of C-bodies, so a C-body is an aggregate.
	2. An aggregate is a collection of things in some relation (its unity is in some way mental).
		* Several things collected together as one thing.
	3. An aggreagate is real only if its constituents are true unities (substances).
	4. So if an aggreagate is composed of aggregates, which are composed of aggregates endlessly - the decomposition set contains nothing but aggregates, and it is unreal.
	5. So a C-body is unreal.
- Heaps of stones
	+ Classic example of vagueness
	+ Take one stone away, do you still have a heap of stones?
	+ Well, yeah, if it's big enough.
	+ But then what about if you do it again?
	+ And again?
	+ When you only have two?
	+ When you only have one?
	+ When you have none?
- Bodies may be like heap of stones, indeterminate about their number.
- Unless you can percieve something like substanial forms.
- Either bodies are merely extended on par with rainbows and heaps, or they have substantial forms and souls.
- What's wrong with material things that are extended?
- Descartes maintains that bodies are subtances and are extended in three-dimensions.
	+ Minds are entirely different things.
- A substance could have in its instance nothing but extension.
- Descartes has an extremely difficult time explaining what a human being is.
- "You've got some extension and you attach a human mind to it and you have a subtantial form."
- Arnauld is a Cartesian, he think Descartes is right about the mind and body.
- If a body is a substance, it has to be connected to a substantial form.
- A soul is a substance, so it has to be connected to a substantial form.
- In his second letter, Arnauld focuses on two questions:
	1. World apart thesis
		* The body can't have causal influence on the soul and vice versa
	2. Something that's merely extended can't be a substance.
		* A Cartesian body can't be a substance.
		* Leibniz:
		
				soul = substantial form + body = substance
		* He never refers to the soul as a simple substance.
		* There is a kind of duality here, the soul as a substantil form.
		* He points out that it satisfies the defintion.
			1. Immaterial,
			2. Not composed of parts,
			3. Can't be destroyed,
			4. Can't be corrupted
			5. Contains all past and future states
			6. All states of the universe
		* Substances as parts of substances.
		* What he calls substances on the right side of the formula above is "corporeal."
		* He expressed uncertainty about what are corporeal.

## February 25th, 2013 - Reading: Chris Swoyer, 'Leibnizian Expression', *Journal of the History of Philosophy* 33 (1995), 65-94

### Leibniz on Expression

> I set out the relevant data for this project, including Leibniz's terse characterizations of expression, his examples of it, and, what is often neglected by those commentators who do explore the notion, his views about the role of expression in human reasoning.

#### Leibniz's Characterizations of Expression.

> I. That is said to express a thing in which there are relations that correspond to the relations of the thing expressed.


> II. One thing expresses another, when there is a constant and ordered relation between what can be asserted of the one and what can be asserted of the other.


> III. it is sufficient for the expression of one thing in another [sufficit enim ad expressionem unius in alio] that there should be a certain constant relational law, by which particulars in the one can be referred to corresponding particulars in the other.

#### Leibniz's Examples of Expression

- But these are too brief.
- Leibniz's favorite example is the perspectival projection of a figure onto a plane. Examples:
	+ When a circle is projected onto an ellipse, the latter is an expression of the former
	+ In analytic geomtry, numbers and figures represent geometric figures.
	+ In algebra, numbers and figures represent magnitudes.
	+ A map expresses the geographical region that it depicts.
	+ A miniature model of a machine expresses the machine
	+ Perception is an expression of that which is perceived
		* our ideas of color, warmth, and other sensory qualities are really expressions of the motions of minute figures
	+ General concepts express things.
		* the idea of a circle expresses the circle itself
	+ Words express the things that they signify
	+ Numerals express numbers
	+ Speech expresses thought
	+ each monad expresses the entire universe
	
#### Leibniz on the Role of Expression in Human Reasoning.

> IV. What is common to all these expressions is that we can pass from a consideration of the relations in the expression to a knowledge of the corresponding properties of the thing expressed.

+ For example, the idea of a circle expresses a circle, and although it "is not similar to the circle, truths can be derived from it which would be confirmed beyond doubt by investigating a real circle"

> V. Characters are certain things by which the relationships among other things are expressed and which are easier to manage than the things themselves.

- We need valid symbols to derive truths about what is smbolized.
- This stems from the role of expression in Leibniz's philosophy.

> All of our reasoning is nothing but the combining and substitution of characters, whether those characters are words, marks, or even images 

### Perspectival Projection As The Paradigm Of Expression

- These explicit sources are not enough for inquiry.

#### Perspectival projections

> VI. Thus, a circle can be represented by an ellipse (that is, an oval curve) in a perspectival projection, and indeed by a hyperbola, which is most unlike it, and does not even return upon itself; for to any point of the hyperbola a corresponding point of the circle which projects the hyperbola can be assigned by the same constant law.

- And his response to Arnauld in passage (2) runs more fully:

> VII. One thing expresses another, in my language, when there is a con- stant and ordered relation between what can be asserted of the one and what can be asserted of the other. It is in this way that a projec- tion in perspective expresses a geometric figure.

- In *Theodicy*,

> VIII. There must always be an exact relation between the representation and the thing [it expresses].... The projections in perspective of the conic sections of the circle show that one and the same circle may be represented by an ellipse, a parabola, a hyperbola, and even another circle, a straight line and a point. 

- In *New Essays*,

> IX. ... [A]n ellipse, and even a parabola or hyperbola, has some resem- blance to the circle of which it is a projection on a plane, since there is a certain precise and natural relationship between what is projected and the projection which is made from it, with each point on the one corresponding through a certain relation with a point on the other.

- our sensory ideas express the motions of the particles that cause them,
- **Correlating relation**: a relation that establishes such a correspondence.
	+ Like a **function**, a mapping of the points of the original figure to their counterparts in the figure that expresses it. Bijective.

#### The Method of Projection and Section.

- Just like when an artist paints something, the representation being dependant on the angle of view, distorting the original form into something dependant on the viewer's capacity to be tricked,
	+ In the same way, an circle view obliquely is a ellipse.
- For those paintings done in accordance with the rules of perspective, we have little trouble "being tricked."
	+ While some of the original is distorted, some of the original structure is also preserved, then.
- So which of the original features is preserved and which of them are destroyed/distorted?
- When Leibniz tells us that there is an "exact" or a "precise and natural" relation between the points of the two figures in a perspectival projection, he is also noting the much deeper relation- ship that holds between a conic section and its perspectival projections

#### Morals for an Account of Perspectival Expression

- **Perspectival expression**: The expression of one geometrical figure by a perspectival projection of it onto another.
- Features that are preserved by a transformation are said to be **invariant** under it.
- Surrogative reasonging:

		       1. Correlating relation
		R(a,b) ----------------------> R(a*, b*)
		             preserves R           | 
		                                   | 2. Surrogative reasoning
		                                   |
		3. Inverse of Correlating Relation v
		Q(b,a) ----------------------> Q(b*, a*)
		             preserves Q

- Steps of **surrogative reasoning**:
	1. We can encode information about the original situation as information about the relationships among the corresponding items in the expression. `a*` bears `R` to `b*`
	2. Because information about the original relationships is pre- served by the corresponding relationships among items in the expression, much of the original information is also preserved by inferences about the constituents of the expression.
	3.  In a perspectival projection, preservation of structure runs both ways, and so we can make the return trip to a conclusion about relationships among the original items of interest.
	
#### An Account of Perspectival Expression

- **Perspectival expression**: "the points in the original figure stand in a given projective relation (or have a given projective attribute) just in case the surrogates of those points in the expression stand in the counterpart of that relation (or have the counterpart of that attribute). Hence, the essential feature of a perspectival expression is that the pattern of projective relations and attributes among the constituents of the represented phenomena is mirrored by the pattern of such relations and attributes among the constituents of the expression of it."
- In passage I, Leibniz tells us that one thing expresses a second when it contains "relations which correspond to the relations of the thing expressed."
- In passage II, Leibniz tells us that one thing expresses another "when there is a constant and ordered relation between what can be asserted of the one and what can be asserted of the other."
- In passage III, Leibniz tells us that it is sufficient for the expression of one thing in another that there be a "constant relational law, by which particulars in the one can be referred to corresponding particulars in the other."
