Leibniz <small>with Professor Martha Bolton</small>
===================================================

Syllabus
--------

### Texts

Assigned and recommended readings will be papers, letters, and published
articles of Leibniz, as well as some secondary sources. Readings will be
on electronic reserve although there will also be class handouts. Many
of the readings are taken from a collection of writings of Leibniz which
is available at the bookstore, G. W. Leibniz, Philosophical Essays, tr.
Roger Ariew and Daniel Garber. Purchase is optional; all assigned
readings will be available electronically.

### Requirements

You are expected to attend all meetings of the class and to do all
reading assignments thoroughly and promptly. Assignments should be read
at least once for the class meeting in which they are to be discussed.
You are strongly encouraged to participate in class discussion. This
helps you and everyone in the class to learn by exploring them yourself.
There will be one short paper (roughly 5 pages) assigned during the
semester and a long paper (roughly 12-15 pages) due at the end of
course. There may be additional out-of-class written assignments,
quizzes, or in-class exercises.

### Learning goals

The course is intended to provide a good understanding of some of the
central doctrines of Leibniz's metaphysics and theory of cognition, the
reasoning by which we supports them, their strengths and weakness,
historical context and significance. It is also meant to develop skill
in analyzing and evaluating arguments, as well as developing,
supporting, and expressing views of one's own.

January 23rd, 2013 - Lecture: The alphabet of thought and method of demonstrating truths
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Leibniz lived between 1646 to 1716
-   In the part of the world we now call Germany, there was terrible
    religious war and plague.
-   Public debates were held where the public tried to decide which was
    "the religion."
-   The people who were Calvinist may have had comfort or distress based
    on radical predetermination.
    -   The idea, starkly, is if you're saved, you don't worry about.
    -   Conversely, in the Roman Catholic religion, works are important.
    -   This is one brand of Protestantism, and it was stark and hard to
        live with.
    -   There are lot of religious debates over this.

-   There was a flourishing of counter-Reformation art, commissioned by
    the church.
-   There are a lot of treatises on self-help and logic, critical
    thinking.
-   This was a counter-Reformation strategy, these self-help manuals.
-   This has to do with the social contract theory.
-   The Eighteenth Century is what we called the "Enlightenment Era",
    and Leibniz bridges the past and the Enlightenment.
-   Leibniz's life
    -   His father was a university professor.
    -   This father instilled a love of learning in him.
    -   Yet, Leibniz was largely self-taught. He taught himself Latin at
        the age of 7.
    -   Leibniz is the co-discoverer of infinitesimal calculus and a
        logician.
    -   He is extremely interested in formal structures, languages and
        symbol systems
    -   He constructed a wooden calculating machine that you could
        "turn."
    -   He was very good at seeing abstract "relations" between things.
    -   He first adopted the views of the scholastics, of Aquinas and
        Aristotle.
        -   Aquinas adopts Aristotle to apply it to Roman Catholiscism.

    -   When 16 years old, he replaces Aristotelian system with
        mechanism.
        -   Mechanism is the view that everything that happens in the
            corporeal world is just matter in motion.
        -   This means matter can be represented in geometry.
        -   The hope is that motion can be represented in mathematical
            formulas.

    -   Leibniz starts out just accepting Aristotelianism, and ends up
        converting to mechanism.
    -   German was a collection of principalities with princes who trade
        with one another.
    -   His teachers recognize his brilliance, and offer him a job, but
        he declines it and goes into public office.
    -   He was sent to Paris on a diplomatic mission. This was a
        revolution for Leibniz.
    -   He learns mathematics from Cartesians and he reads about Galileo
        and Hougins (pendular motion).
    -   He comes alive intellectually here in this "Paris period"
        (1672-1676), and he was eventually called back.
    -   This laid the foundations for his philosophy and his mathematics
        and his motions, all formulated here.
    -   He was working on what he calls the "foundation of cognition."
    -   Career
        -   He goes back to England speaks with Spinoza (exiled Jewish
            naturalist), Oldenburg
        -   Goes back to Germany and settles in Hanover.
        -   He has a variety of employers in and around the court.
        -   Engineering projects, diplomatic projects.
        -   He came up with the idea of distracting France by pointing
            out Egypt.
        -   He is the court historian.
        -   He comes up with a geological history of his region.
        -   One thing for which he is famous is that he was working with
            the ancestors of George Ludwig, and he discovers that
            languages change.
        -   While he is doing this research, he finds documents that
            establish a connection between George Ludwig and the British
            monarchy.
        -   When the Brits ran out of monarchs, this made Ludwig become
            George the First of England.

    -   Aside from his career, he had private projects.
    -   He wanted to reconcile Protestantism with Catholicism.
    -   He is very interested in codes and code-breaking (with Wallace).
    -   Interested in physics, theology - Jesuits, protestants, - many
        other things.
    -   He is intellectually engaged in almost everything that is going
        on.

-   Leibniz's thoughts
    -   Cognition
        -   Humans and animals both participate in cognition, but humans
            also participate in knowledge.
        -   Prof. Bolton doesn't believe that her cat has beliefs, and
            that if her cat does, the cat is unwarranted in holding the,
            -   Well, she does, but only because she's so fond of her
                cat.

        -   How does what goes on in a mind or a soul, a cognitive
            being, sense perception, related to its environment, so that
            there is actual intaking of information? Not just atoms.
        -   We also have information about what is, what could be, what
            might be, what ought be, what is necessarily true, etc.
        -   There is "mind-world" and "super world" cognition.
        -   He comes up with the thought that we think of many things
            that are complex, but if we think of complex things, there
            must be simple things that they are made of.
        -   Our thoughts must be composed of simple thoughts.
        -   What are the simples? If you could only find the simples,
            you'd have a powerful instrument.
        -   He has this vision that there is an alphabet of human
            thought.
        -   He becomes discouraged, but he has plenty of projects trying
            to find it.

    -   Classical metaphysical thoughts
        -   Is there anything that remains? Stays the same?
        -   If god exists, then god remains.

    -   The mains philosophical works are:
        1.  *Meditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas* (1684)
        2.  *Discourse on Metaphysics* (1686)
        3.  *Specimen of Dynamics* (1695)
        4.  'New System of the nature and Communications of Substances'

January 28th, 2013 - Reading
----------------------------

### Leibniz's 'Of an Oragnum or Ars Magna of Thinking' (1679)

-   The supreme happiness is the greatest increase in one's own
    perfection.
-   Vigor shares the same relationship over health as disease is under
    health.
-   The most powerful human faculty is thinking.
    -   Assisted by either remedies of body or mind.

-   Remedies of bodies are applied to corporeal organs directly.
-   Remedies of mind are those modes of thinking that make other
    thoughts easier.
-   The greatest remedy of mind is the modes of thinking which infinite
    others arise - like the numbers 1 through 10 can generate all other
    numbers.
-   Thoughts must be "built on" something - there must be a point where
    you have "the most simple" thought(s).
-   Another example is that all numbers can be built on using everything
    and nothing, 0 and 1, using the binary system.

### Leibniz's 'Preface to Universal Characteristic' (1678-9)

-   God made all using weight, measure, and number. Mechanism.
-   Those things that cannot be weighed because they have no force or
    power.
-   Also things that "lack parts," and thus cannot be measured.
-   There is nothing that can't be numbered, however. This is how
    everything is investigated.
-   Since Pythagoras, people have thought there to be mystery in
    numbers.
-   Because they lacked understanding, they slipped into superstition
    and futility.
-   This nonsense still fills books, and also, the belief that numbers
    can discover amazing things remains.
-   The Universal Characteristic is a language in which "all notions and
    things are nicely ordered."
-   Yet no one has discovered a language which does what numbers do.
-   When he was young, Leibniz saw that no one could devise a certain
    alphabet of human thoughts.
-   Leibniz spends quite a while calling other people stupid for not
    having thought of this because he did it when he was a youth.
-   When the characteristic numbers of notions is determined, it will do
    for the mind what glasses did for the eyes.

> When we have a true characteristic number of things, then at last,
> without any mental effort or danger of error, we will be able to judge
> whether arguments are indeed materially sound and draw the right
> conclusions.

### Leibniz's 'Samples of the Numerical Characteristic' (1679)

-   Observes that while sometimes an argument leads to the correct
    conclusion, it is not because of sound argument or true premises.
-   Every categorical proposition has two times: the subject and the
    predicate.
-   The quality of the proposition is affirmation or negation.
-   The quantity of the proposition is universality or particularity.
-   In every proposition, the predicate is said to be in the subjection.
-   For example, "Every man is an animal" means "The concept of animal
    is contained in the concept of man."
-   Leibniz does some weird and goofy number assignment and negative
    stuff here.

January 28th, 2013 - Lecture
----------------------------

-   Remember that Leibniz escapes from nothern Germany to Paris, and he
    is called back to Germany to write 'Of an Organum or Ars of
    Thinking.'
-   He's interested in what can be done for personal happines and the
    happiness of society in general.
-   He's thinking that improving our power of thinking would go a long
    way to improve happines.
-   He's thinking that if you can take the "smallest" truth and use it
    to build other truths, it would be more efficient.
-   So he comes up with this argument - either you can see this thing,
    or you can see this thing through something else.
-   What's the distinction between:
    1.  concieving of something and
    2.  concieving of something through another "thing"

-   If you want to concieve an even number, you concieve of a number
    through something else, the specific type of number it is.
    -   You think of a number,
    -   And of a number divisible by two.

-   Suppose I think of a triangle, do I think solely of a triangle or do
    I think of it through another concept.
-   The concept of an odd number is that of a number and of a number not
    divisible by two.
-   To be precise, concept A (involves, includes, contains) concept B.
-   Leibniz is thinking that if you cannot concieve of justice without
    virtue, this is relevant.
-   He's got an argument that since we concieve some things through
    other things, there has to be concepts which are ultimately simple,
    that they aren't built from others, that they are independant
    conceptions.
-   From these basics, we can build the comples.
-   How does he show that there are these simple concepts?
-   Leibniz is thinking that you can always ask whether a concept is
    "simple" or "complex."
-   If nothing is concieved as itself, nothing can be concieved at all.
-   You cannot think of a compound concept without actually thinking
    about the sum of it's parts.
-   A point about Leibniz's argument:
    -   Could it be that there are complex concepts, but that they come
        in "familys."
    -   That any member of any given family could be used to build
        another, forming a "circularity."
    -   For instance:
        -   A point is simple.
        -   A line is motion of a point.
        -   A plane is the motion of a line.

    -   And additionally:
        -   A plane is simple.
        -   A line is the intersection of two planes.
        -   A point is the intersection of two lines.

    -   This is the distinction between "wholists" and "atomists."

-   Leibniz thought that maybe the only thing "concieved throught
    itself" is god.
-   One of his thoughts is that everything is composed of limits on the
    infinite.
    -   He never fully sketched this idea out.
    -   He was "attracted" to this idea.

-   Leibniz is thinking that is you have the simple concepts and you
    assign them "symbols", then, just by mechanically generating all the
    allowable symbols, you could generate all the concepts.
-   So Leibniz has the idea that given symbols of all concepts, you
    would have the symbols to generate all propositions, and you'll be
    able to determine whether the propositions were true.
-   He has this thought of forming an artificial languages.
-   The concept containment theory of truth
    -   He is making assumptions about propositions.
    -   Aristotle's logic is that there are basic propositions which
        build all other propositions. There are four:
        1.  All A is B ? the concept of A contains the concept of B.
        2.  No A is B ? the concept of A contains the concept of not B.
        3.  Some A is B ? the concept of A and the some concept of
            something X contains the concept of B.
        4.  Some A is not B ? the concept of A + X contains the conceopt
            of not B.

> In every true proposition the concept of the predicate is somehow
> contained in the concept of the subject.

-   Anything that satisfies the subject satisfies the predicate.

### Leibniz's 'That a Most Perfect Being Exists' (1676)

-   Simple concepts are perfect forms and they are impossible to access.
-   Only "universal propositions" can be stated about that which cannot
    be demonstrated.
-   "Necessary identical propositions are identical."
    -   An indentical proposition is something akin to "A is A."

-   As many simple forms as you want can exist in the same subject.
-   Existence is one of these simple forms, one of the perfections.
-   Therefore, a most perfect being must exist.
    -   Q.E.D. stands for "quod erat demonstrandum", which means "which
        had to be demonstrated."

-   An argument:
    -   What is necessary, necessarilly exists.
    -   Whatever necessarilly exists, exists.
    -   Therefore, a necessary being exists.

#### [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Leibniz: The Existence of God](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/#ExiGod)

-   Leibniz thinks that perfection is a "simple quality which is
    positive and absolute, or, which expresses without any limits
    whatever it does express."
-   From this, it follows that "there can be no inconsistency among
    perfections, since a perfection, in being simple and positive, is
    unanalyzable and incapable of being enclosed by limits."
-   Compounding any and all simple truths will never be incompatible.
-   Therefore, it is possible that all simples are compatible.
-   This argument is not sufficient to demonstrate that god necessarilly
    exists.

January 30th, 2013 - Lecture: Method of demonstration and the existence of God
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   There are two things: things you think of through others and things
    you think of through itself.
-   There has to be simple concepts, otherwise we couldn't think of
    anything.
-   You can't think a thought of something without "bottoming out" on a
    simple concept eventually.
-   By relating simple concepts, you get all other concepts that there
    are.
-   Then, a proposition is made out of concepts.
-   All basic propositions are "subject/predicate" propositions, joined
    by "is" and "is not."
-   All other propositions can be formed from basic propositions.
-   They are all universal, negative, existential, affirmitive.
-   We can get all basic propositions from the alphabet of human
    thought.
-   When you have subject concept and predicate concept, decompose the
    two, and you'll find that every concept in the subject is in the
    predicate, the "simple concepts" that for the two concepts will be
    identical.
    -   Is everything that is true "vacuously true"?
        -   No - because every simple concept is ground in god.

-   Leibniz is thinking that the connection between "Every A is B" is
    loose enough that facts about the world are possible.
-   Leibniz is worried about this problem, this is a preface, an
    anticpation.
-   If you grant "simple concepts", all of the above follows.

### Leibniz's 'That a Most Perfect Being Exists' (1676)

-   Ontological argument
-   Subject to a lot of objections
-   Anselm and Leibniz, revived by Descartes
-   Leibniz grants what a lot of critics deny: that existence is an
    attribute.
-   Existence, for Leibniz, is something that is ascribed to a thing (as
    opposed to presupposed when you prescribe anything else).
-   He does not grant that existence is perfection.
-   Necessary existence is different from mere existence, it is
    eternally unshakable.
-   It's quite an extraordinary way of being, and it is a perfection.
-   When we form this definition that god is the most perfect being, we
    put words together, and have concepts.
-   You can do this in a way that you don't define anything because of
    contradiction.
-   "A regular 12-sided polygon" - geometrically impossible but "valid"
    definition.
-   When we toss out a definition, we may only be talking formally, but
    you're talking nonsense.
-   In "Ars Magna", the second part, he says we can't trace back the
    "simples" all the way, but we can get far enough.
-   We've got to halt and no reason on the basis of some definition.
-   If this definition of god is something that's possible, it shows
    that it exists.
-   He undertakes showing that is possible that a necessary being
    exists.
-   He's going to use the apparatus of the concept containment of truth.
-   This is very abstract.
-   Argument:
    1.  Perfections are undefinable or have concepts that are
        unanalyzable.
        -   The first thing is: he defines perfection as absolute
            positive quality.
        -   Also indefinable and unanalyzable.
        -   Once you have the notion of unlimited extension, you can
            specify parts of it.
        -   There are endless ways of specifying an unlimited concept,
            but when you do, you are inevitable limiting it.
        -   All perfections are limitless attributes, no limitation
            built-in to them.
        -   By virtue of this, they are simple.
        -   If you've got a proposition about a perfection, the subject
            is unalazable, it is "immune" to demonstration.

    2.  A necessarilly true proposition that is indemonstrable is an
        indentity.
        -   If you've got an indemonstrable proposition that is
            necessarilly true, it's got to be that the subject concept
            has to be in the predicate concept.
        -   Every A is AB

    3.  Suppose it's not possible that A and B are perfections and that
        A and B belong to the same thing.
        -   Let's consider this supposition as expressed by the
            following: "A is B-incompatible."
        -   This is not an identity.
        -   It's undefinable, unalazable.
        -   Can't be demonstrated.
        -   But a necessarilly true proposition is an identity, so this
            isn't a necessary truth.

    4.  "A is B-incompatible" is not an identity and not demonstrable.
        So it's not necesarilly true.
        -   This also works with "A is B-compatible." This seems to
            break the argument?
        -   All Leibniz wants to show is that it's not impossible.
        -   So "A is B-incompatible" is possible true.

### Homework

-   All cockerspaniels are dogs.
    -   Subject: cocker spaniels
    -   Predicate: all are dogs.
    -   "In every true proposition the concept of the predicate is
        somehow contained in the concept of the subject."
    -   Cockerspaniels are a complex idea experienced through the
        concept of dog, along with the other properties of
        cockerspaniels.
    -   Symbolically, cockerspaniels can be represented as {$
        \mathrm{dog}, q\_1, q\_2, ... , q\_n $} where qs are qualities
        unique to cockerspaniels and "dog" is the set of all concepts in
        dog.
    -   The concept of dog is a complex idea experienced through other
        ideas, but it does not need to be defined here. Let {dog} be the
        set of all dog qualities.
    -   Because {dog} $ \in $ {$ \mathrm{dog}, q\_1, q\_2, ... ,
        q\_n $}, all cocker spaniels are dogs.

-   All triangles have three angles.
    -   Triangle's are complex ideas experienced through: {shape,
        polygon, three angles, three edges, ...}
    -   {three angles} $\in$ {shape, polygon, three angles, three
        edges, ...}
    -   So $ \forall x $ if x is a triangle $ \to $ x has three
        angles

-   Water is liquid at room temperature
    -   We experience water through the simpler concepts of: {chemical
        compound, 2 hydrogen 1 oxygen}
    -   You cannot prove this with Leibnizian logic because you need
        causation.
    -   The concept of liquid is not "contained within" the concept of
        water.

### Leibniz's 'On Contingency' (1686?)

-   Existence does not differ from essence for god.
-   It is essential for god to exist.
-   God is a necessary being.
-   Creatures are contingent in that their existence does not follow
    from their essence.
    -   This is what it must be to be mortal.
    -   Leibniz think that god's essence $ \to $ god's being.

-   Necessary truths are those that can be demonstrated through analysis
    of terms.
    -   This is "Leibnizian logic" - see cocker spaniels exercise.
    -   Example: An equation expressing an identity ultimately results
        from substitution of terms.
    -   "Everything true is an identity"

-   We does say that both god and creatures exist.
-   Necessary propositions are no less true than contingent ones.
-   One can always give a reason for every non-identical proposition.
    -   In necessary propositions, reason necessitates.
    -   In contingent propositions, it inclines.

-   Of things that exist, they have more "reason to exist" that things
    which do not exist.
-   In contingent propositions, there comes a point where only god can
    further understand the infinite analysis.
-   One can ask whether this proposition is necessary: Nothing exists
    without there being a greater reason for it to exist that for it to
    not.
-   Not all possibles attain existence, otherwise nothing novel could be
    imagined, yet they obviously can be.
-   There are an infinite number of series of possible things, and one
    series cannot be contained within another. Therefore:
    1.  God always acts with the mark of perfection and wisdom.
    2.  Not every possible thing attains existence.

-   "The proposition that has the greater reason for existing exists."
    -   Existing means "being true."
    -   Exists means "is true"
    -   This proposition is necessarily true.

February 4th, 2013 - Lecture: The infinite analysis theory of contingent truth
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Even without the proof of the possibility of god, the argument
    discussed last time has some "moral weight."
-   It's not valueless, even if nobody has proved the possibility of a
    being with all perfections.
-   While we're waiting, people should work on trying to prove the
    possibility of god, and Leibniz thinks he has.
-   "We're entitled to assume the possibility of any being until someone
    shows the contrary."
-   If something exists rather than nothing, something is possible.
-   We ought to have a bias in favor of the possible because of reality.
-   He often remarks with regards to Euclid that it was the closest to
    science in the 17th century, that he couldn't prove that a line was
    the shortest distance between two points.
-   Leibniz is just barely out of university when he wrote what we're
    reading.
-   They're also unpublished.
-   These are comparable to the false start in papers.
-   One of the things that the professor likes about reading Leibniz's
    early work is that you can try to figure out how his mind is working
    and how he forming and revising his opinions.
-   Towards this end, homework.
    -   Triangle
        -   The concepts which we have through names, lexical ones, are
            very complex.
        -   Relative to the alphabet of human thought, that is.
        -   There are lots of ways of decomposing the analysis of the
            whole thing, triangle.
        -   This depends on how many "simples" there are in the concept.
        -   Leibniz remarks on this from time to time.
        -   When he talks about a definition or an analysis, he is
            thinking about something that is coextensive with it.

    -   Water
        -   You have to engage in an analysis of water.
        -   Can we go outside on what we know just on the basic of
            concepts.

-   Leibnizz thinks we need to proceed by analyzing terms, and if we're
    doing this in the English language, we're using definitions.
-   We are trying to do these analyses in English, and Leibniz is well
    aware that it is not a perfect language, for that reason, if we try
    to use English, we'll run into problems.
-   To actually implement of proof that Leibniz calls demonstration, we
    would really need an ideal language.
-   The more logical and precise your language, the further you can get
    with these proofs.
-   There are these "hitches" and "things to take into account" given
    our knowledge.
-   He continues to use this as the standard of demonstration.
-   When he talks about demonstration, he is talking about a high gauge
    notion which irrecvibly shows something.
-   There are arguments which aren't demonstration that are still
    valuable.
-   You have to start from where you are, and you're not an ideal point,
    you'll have to use arguments which aren't solid.
-   But keep track of your assumptions and check them - this is how you
    make progress.

### Leibniz's 'On the Nature of Truth' (1686)

-   This is later than the Paris period, and he's still thinking his way
    through the concept cointainment theory of truth.
-   There are three illustrations of Leibniz's difficulties.
-   He's trying to figure out how to make it work.
-   He starts out by saying every proposition is either true or false,
    but not both.
-   There is no proposition that is indeterminate.
-   If a proposition p is false, then the contradictory of p is true.
    $ p $ and $\lnot p $ are contradictory.
    -   Law of non-contradiction
    -   Interestingly, this law cannot be proved, because you'd have to
        use propositions.

-   A true proposition is one which the concept of the predicate is
    contained the concept of the subject, meaing there is a connection,
    and it is objective, built into reality.
-   This containment can be express or virtual, which means in the
    context "potential."
-   This connection is either necessary of contigent.
    -   Necessary if it follows from definitions and consequences.
    -   Contigent if different things are true at different times. (This
        is only one kind)
        -   Also, it's not necessarily true or false, it's a
            propositions that's possibly true or false, but happens to
            be true.
        -   The impossibility of that thing is not necesarilly true.
        -   They vary in time.
        -   There is no necessary connection.
        -   We assume they follow from free decress of god.
        -   Always have to do with things that exist, are natural, about
            things that do exist other than god and the assumption is
            that they exist because god wills that they exist.

    -   The principle of sufficient reason: For every true proposition,
        there is a reason for it being true rather than otherwise.
        -   Nothing happens which a reason cannot be given for it
            happening rather than otherwise.
        -   No proposition is true without there being a reason.

### Homework

-   Look at the last paragraph of 'On the Nature of Truth'
-   Principle of Sufficient Reason
    -   See how Leibniz is toying with whether it's necessary or
        continent.

-   'On Contingency'
-   'On Freedom'
-   'Primary Truths' (read but we will not talk about)

----------------------------

### Principle of Sufficient Reason

#### [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_sufficient_reason)

The principle of sufficient reason states that nothing is without a
ground or reason why it is.

-   For every entity *x*, if *x* exists, then there is a sufficient
    explanation for why *x* exists.
-   For every event *e*, if *e* occurs, then there is a sufficient
    explanation for why *e* occurs.
-   For every proposition *p*, if *p* is true, then there is a
    sufficient explanation for why *p* is true.

> We have said that the concept of an individual substance [Leibniz also
> uses the term haecceity ] includes once for all everything which can
> ever happen to it and that in considering this concept one will be
> able to see everything which can truly be said concerning the
> individual, just as we are able to see in the nature of a circle all

> is necessary.

#### [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/)

> The principle of sufficient reason, namely, that nothing happens
> without a reason.

-   all truths rest upon two great principles:
    1.  the Principle of Contradiction (which says that a truth is
        necessary just in case its negation is a contradiction)
    2.  and the PSR

### Leibniz's 'On Freedom' (1689?)

-   How freedom and contingency can coexist is one of the oldest human
    worries.
-   The worry is increased when you add Christianity to the affair.
-   When Leibniz considered that nothing happened by chance, he was
    close to the view that everything was absolutely necessary.
-   Some think that it's enough to be un-coerced, even if we're subject
    to necessity.
-   There are certain possibilities that will never be.
-   There are fictions that have no place is this universal series god
    selected.
    -   Unless the universe contains everything.
    -   This would eliminate all beauty.

-   All creatures have impressed upon them a certain mark of divine
    infinity.
-   There is no portion of matter so tiny that it does not contain a
    sort of world of creatures of infinite number.
-   Even though in contingent truths, the predicate is in the subject,
    it can never be demonstrated as an equality or identity.
    -   God alone can see it though.
    -   This is derived from his intellect.

-   Two ways remains for us to know continent truths:
    1.  Experience: when we perceive a thing sufficiently distinly
        through the sense.
    2.  Reason: when something is know from the general principle that
        nothing is without a reason, or that there is always some reason
        why the predicate is in the subject.

-   God made everything in the most perfect way, an he does nothing
    without a reason, and nothing happens anywhere unless he who
    understands understands its reasons.
-   God knowns infinite and contigent truths not by demonstrastion, as
    this would imply contradiction, but rather by divine intuition.
    -   This intution is not experiential, but rather one of *a priori*.

-   Having accepted the notion that necessity everyone accepts, which is
    that those things whose contrary implies a contradiction.

### Leibniz's 'Primary Truths' (1689)

-   The primary truths are those which assert the same thing of itself
    or deny the opposite of its opposite.
    -   A is A
    -   Not-A is not-A
    -   "Everything is as it is."
    -   "Everything is similar or equal to itself."
    -   "Nothing is greater or less than itself."

-   All remaining truths are reducded to primary truths with the help of
    definitions.
    -   Through resolution of other notions.
    -   A proof indepedant of experience.
    -   "The whole is greater than its part."
    -   "The part is less than the whole."
    -   Something esaily demostrated from the definition of less or
        greater.
        -   Arguement:

        1.  The part is equal to a part of the whole.
        2.  What is equal to a part of a whole is less than the whole.
        3.  Therefore, the part is less than the whole.

-   Therefore the predicate is always in the subject.
-   This is truth for every affirmitive truth, universal or particular,
    necessary or contigent.
-   Things that follow from this:
    -   Nothing is without reasons.
    -   There is no effect without cause.
    -   When in the givens everything on one side is the same as the
        other side.
    -   There is even a reason for eternal things.
    -   There cannot be two individual things that differ in number
        alone.
    -   There are no purely extrinsic demominations.
    -   Every individual substance contains in its perfect notion the
        entire universe.
    -   All individual created substances are different expressions of
        the same universe.
    -   No created substance exerts a metaphysical action or influx on
        any other thing.
    -   Assuming the distinction between soul and body allows us to
        explain their union.
    -   There is no vacuum.
    -   There is no atom.
    -   Every particle of the unverse contains a world of an infitiy of
        creatures.
    -   There is no determinate shape in actual things.
    -   Corporeal substance can neither arise nor perish except through
        creation or annihilation.
    -   Animate things neither arise nor perish, but are only
        transformed.

February 6th, 2013 - Lecture: More consequences of the 'predicate in notion' theory of truth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The infinite analysis will always yield a reason a true proposition
    is true.
-   We have the principle of sufficient reason.
-   A couple of questions:
    1.  Whether the PSR has a sufficient reason.
        -   There's a kind of reason for thinking there is a reason for
            the PSR.
        -   It's a truth, Leibniz says.
        -   All truths have SR.
        -   So what's the SR for the PSR?
        -   God does nothing without a reason?
        -   If it is contigent, god could have created the PSR false.
        -   But surely it's necessary.
        -   If you grant the concept containment theory of truth, then
            you have to analyze the terms.

    2.  How you'll bring together the PSR, god creates the world, how
        the PSR governs god, and how a lot of things are contigently
        true.

-   Leibniz attempts to clean up his PSR by distinguishing existence and
    propositions.
-   The thing is that "*x* exists\* is a proposition.
-   Leibniz wants to say:
    1.  God exists essentially-necessarily.
    2.  Creatures exist contigently.
    3.  There are truths that are necessary.
    4.  There are truths that are contigent.

-   But what are common between necessary and contingent beings and
    necessary and contigent truths?
-   Two questions come up:
    1.  Is it necessary for god to choose the best?
        -   The best of the alternatives.
        -   The greater of the opposite.

    2.  Is it necessary that nothing exists without there being a
        greater reason for it to exist than not?
        -   The only reason that will appeal to an infinitely powerful
            and knowing agent is that one of the possible alternatives
            is the best.
        -   Here's a problem: Adam exists. Adam sins. God created this.
            How does is this resolved?
        -   Everything for Leibniz, nothing is isolated in it existence.
        -   Leibniz will fill this in in the material world, with the
            fact that matter is infnitely divisable and extenable.
        -   One motion has material consequences for everything else in
            the world.
        -   Everything in the world is also influenced by everything in
            the world.
        -   If you want a full account of why someone sneezes, you have
            to describe the whole universe.
        -   The things that are present in material things that are
            diversified infinitely.

-   The necessity of the consequence does not determine the necessity of
    the consequent.
-   If Zero Dark Thirty won the Oscar, it got the most number of votes.
    If it wins, it is necessary it does. But it's not necessary it does.

### Leibniz's 'On Freedom'

-   One of the reasons Leibniz is so interested in matters of fact being
    contigent in the actual world is that he wants to preserve
    accountability.
-   He wants to preserve freedom.
-   What counts as freedom?

### Definitions

-   **Concept Containment Theory of Truth**: In every true proposition,
    the concept of the predicate is contained in the concept of the
    subject, either the analysis is finite or inifite, but in either
    case the connection between concepts is the reason for the
    propositions truth.
-   **Principle of Sufficient Reason**: For every true proposition there
    is a reason for it, being true rather than false.

### 'Discourse on Metaphysics' (1686)

#### 1. On Divine Perfection, and That God Does Everything in the Most Desirable Way

-   God is an absolutely perfect being
    -   This is the best way we can describe god
    -   We also need to consider what it actually means.
    -   There are several different perfections in nature.
        -   God possesses them all together.

-   What is a perfection?
    -   Things that are not capable of a highest degree are *not*
        perfections.
    -   The "greatest of all number/figures" imply a contradiction, so
        not perfection.
    -   On the otherhand, knowledge has "all knowledge", so it's a
        perfection,
    -   Power and knowledge are perfections, insofar as they belong to
        god.

-   God:
    1.  Posseses infinite and supreme wisdom
    2.  Acts in the perfect manner in:
        -   Metaphysical matters,
        -   Moral matters

#### 2. Against Those Who Claim That There Is No Goodness in God's Work, or That the Rules of Goodness and Beauty Are Arbitrary

-   Leibniz is far removed from those who maintain there is no good or
    perfect
    -   It can't be so because god is their author, would have
        considered them afterwards, and found them good.
    -   Scriptures are an anthropomorphic expression only to make
        understand the excellence of god'd work.
    -   Through considering the works you can discover the creator.
        -   Therefore, his works carry his mark
        -   The contrary opinion is dangerous

    -   In saying that things are not good by virtue of any rule of
        goodness but by the whim of god, you destroy god's love and
        glory.
    -   Where will his power remain if it is simply despotic?
        -   Besides, all acts presuppose a reason for willing.

    -   Descartes thought that god "could have" willed that a triangle
        have four sides.

#### 3. Against Those Who Believe That God Might Have Made Things Better

-   Nor can Leibniz approve of those who maintain that god could have
    made the world better.
    -   The consequences of this opinion is contrary to the glory of
        god.
        -   A lesser evil is relatively good
        -   A lesser good is relatively evil

    -   Showing that an architect could have done better is to find
        fault with his work.
    -   If their right, the "the series of imperfection descends to
        infinity"
        -   This view is backed by scripture

    -   Leibniz thinks that there is nothing so perfect that there is
        not something more perfect.

-   In this way way, the "moderns" believe that they can safeguard god's
    freedom.
    -   To think that god does something without having a reason does
        not conform to his glory.
    -   Imagine god has a choice between *A* or *B*, chooses *A*,
        without considering *B*.
        -   Being as all praise must be based on some reason, this is
            absurd.

    -   God does nothing for which he does not deserve to be praised.

#### 4. That the Love of God Requires Our Complete Satisfaction and Acquiescence with Respect to What He Has Done without Our Being Quietists as a Result

-   The genral knowlege of this truth is the foundation of the love that
    we owe god
    -   He who loves seeks his satisfaction of the object loved and in
        his actions.
    -   It is difficult to love god when we are not disposed to will
        what god wills.
    -   Those who are not satisfied with god are not much different from
        rebels.

-   To act in accordance to god, it is not sufficient to be patient.
    -   We must be satisfied with everything that comes according to his
        will.
    -   We must not:
        1.  Be quietists
        2.  Stand ridiculously with arms folded

    -   We must:
        1.  Act in accordance with what we presume to be the will of god
        2.  Contribute to the general good

#### 5. What the Rules of the Perfection of Divine Conduct Consist in, and That the Simplicity of the Ways Is in Balance with the Richness of the Effects

-   Therefore it is sufficient to have the confidence that god does
    everthing for the best.
    -   To know in detail the reasons that could have moved him
        surpasses the power of the mind.

-   However, it is possible to make general remarks
    -   He who acts perfectly is similar to an excellent geometer.
    -   The most perfect of all beings occupies the least volume that
        least interfere with one another.

-   On the simplicity of the ways of god
    -   Nothing costs god anything
    -   Since god only has to make decrees in order that a real world
        come into being
    -   The simplest system is always preferred in astronomy.

#### 6. God Does Nothing Which Is Not Orderly and It Is Not Even Possible to Imagine Events That Are Not Regular

-   The volitions or acts of god are divided into two groups:
    1.  Ordinary
    2.  Extraordinary
        -   The extraordinary is only extraordinary relative to god to
            those creatures who have seen an established order

-   In whatever manner god created the world, it would have been regular
    an in accordance with certain general order.
    -   God chose the most perfect world.
        -   In that it is simplest in hypotheses and richest in
            phenomena
        -   Just like a line in geometry whose construction is easy and
            whose properties and effects are remarkable and widespread.

#### 7. That Miracles Conform to the General Order, Even Though They May Be Contrary to the Subordinate Maxims; and about What God Wills or Permits by a General or Particular Volition

-   Nothing happens which is not in order.
    -   Miracles are therefore part of that natural order.
    -   There are the same type of operation as the subordinate maxims
        we call the nature of things.
    -   God can have as much a reason to break these maxims as the make
        the maxims maxims.

-   General and particular volitions
    -   God does everything following his most general will.
        -   This is in conformiaty with the most perfect order

    -   But he can also have particular volitions
        -   These can be exceptions to his general will

    -   The most general are without exception, as they are most within
        his will.

-   God wills everything that is a particular object of his volition
    -   Objects of his general volition are the acts of other creates
    -   If the action is good in itself, we can say that god *wills it*
        and *sometimes commands it*.
        -   Even if it doesn't take place.

    -   If the action is evil in itself and becomes good only by
        accident, then we can say that god *permits* it.
        -   But he does not *will* it.

    -   He concurs with it because of the laws of nature he has
        established and because he knows how to draw greater good from
        it.

#### 8. To Distinguish the Actions of God from Those of Creatures We Explain the Notion of an Individual Substance

-   It is difficult to distinguish the actions of god and creatures
    -   Some believe god does everything.
    -   Some believe god does only what is needed to conserve the energy
        of creatures.

-   When there are several predicates associated with a subject and the
    subject is attributed to no other, it is called an *individual
    substance*.
    -   We must considering what it is to attributed truly to a certain
        subject.

-   Every true predication has some basis in the nature of things.
    -   When the predicate is not contained in the subject, it must be
        contained virtually.
    -   The subject term must alwayus contain the predicate term.

> The notion of an individual substance or of a complete being is to
> have a notion so completel that is is sufficient to contain and to
> allow us to deduce from it all the predicates of the subject to which
> this notion is attributed.

-   The quality of being a kind is not enough to determine enough to
    constitue an individual, nor is it a quality that anything is
    exclusively.
    -   But when god sees Alexander the Great, he sees the basis and
        reason for all predicates.
    -   He knows *a priori* what will happen to him and what did and
        what is.
    -   When we considering the connection of things, we can say that
        Alexander's soul contains vestiges of everything that has
        happened to him and marks everyhing that will happen to him and
        even marks of everything that will happen in the universe.

### Discourse on Metaphysics

-   Leibniz starts out in the first four sections laying out basic
    claims about god.
-   First of all, he tells us the way he understands god and what he is.
    -   Absolutely perfection.

-   What is perfection?
    -   It is a nature or attribute capable of highest degree.
    -   Movement is not a perfection because there isn't a fastest
        motion.
    -   Knowledge is a perfection because there is a knowledge of
        everything.

-   God has each of these perfections without limitations.
-   He goes on deny theistic voluntarism.
    -   Theistic volutarism about *x* is that god willed that *x*.

-   Descartes held the outstanding view that what is true and false is
    due to the will of god.
    -   If you try to think through this doctrine it is mind boggling.

-   He wants to say that the world god created is good not because god
    willed it to be good but because he created it and it was
    indepedantly good, in and of itself.
    -   Is the world good because god will the world be good or is the
        world good because god made a good world?

-   Leibniz has an argument based on the PSR that if god were to will
    that justice be good, it would be, but for a reason, and what better
    reason than justice actually already being god.
-   Two goals:
    1.  Maximal diversity of the world
    2.  Maximal simplicity of the simples. Leibniz has to create a world
        where the simple concepts are as intecllectually appealing as
        possible.

-   The divergence of these is perfection.
-   There are subordinate laws that generally hold in this true, but no
    and then there may be exception based on god's will that violates
    one of these laws.
    -   This violation makes the Universe better than it would be
        otherwise.

-   What does god will when he actually wills that the world exists?
    -   It's delicate because there are bad things.
    -   Does god will bad things?
    -   What should we say about what decrees should exists with regard
        to the actual world in view of all the bad things?
    -   Leibniz answer:
        -   Insofar as god will something in particular volitions, god
            always wills that these things happen.
        -   But about the general laws of nature, there is distinction
            between what god wills and what he concurs with.
        -   To the extent that something is good, he wills it.
        -   To the extent that something is bad, he concurs with it,
            because the world wouldn't be as good without this one bad.
        -   There is nothing god could have done, because he isn't
            volutarist about the possibles.
        -   Questions:
            1.  This presupposes that you can get out some good and some
                bad out of any event, "teasing it out"
            2.  Think of god's will. Omnipotent. If she wills it, it
                happens. If god wills you do something, where is there
                room for you to be bringing that about? God's will will
                do it anyway. Anything you do to bring about it, it's
                going to come about anyway.

        -   What god wills is good. So if you know what god wills, you
            know what's good and will want to do it anyway.
        -   **Nicole**: Without access to knowledge of the will of god,
            so you cannot say that "you did this wrong thing" because of
            the will of god, because you didn't have access to that.
            1.  God is not concerened with freedom or responsibility.
            2.  God may still be the one making us want god's will.

        -   **Nicole**: There's a possibility of the world being
            predetermined without a god.
        -   For Leibniz, god is sustaining, propping up the world.
        -   There are places where Leibniz commits himself to a view
            that Descartes liked, that once the world exists, there's no
            guarentee on it continuing. "Existential inertia."
        -   To get the world up to this moment is contigent on god
            continually recreating and willing the world.
        -   This makes it more difficult to distinguish the productivity
            of the world and the productivity of god.

    -   There are two conflicting doctrings:
        1.  Continual recreation, and
        2.  Continual concurance

    -   Leibniz wants contiual recreation
    -   He also wants to have humans be in a reasonable sense, agents.
    -   Section 8 is about in what sense can god do things and in what
        sense can creatures do things.
    -   There is a meaningful sense to say two things:
        1.  We are agents who choose things.
        2.  God is the ultimate agent who chooses everything.

-   Aristotle's Categories
    -   A substance is something to which other things are attributed
        which cannot be attributed to anything else.
        -   There are some things are exist in others
        -   Some things are neigther said of nor exist in others.

    -   In the world we have these things, which are referred to as some
        things, and never referred to as other things.
    -   Leibniz calls this a nominal definition.
        -   He worries that we can produce a definition that produces
            and conceals a contradiction.

    -   Leibniz's project is to show how this model can be contained
        within the concept containment theory of truth.
    -   "Green is predicated of grass."

February 13th, 2013 - Lecture
-----------------------------

-   **Concept containment definition of individual substance**: *X* is
    an individual substance if and only if the concept of *X* contains
    the basis and reason for everything that can be truly said of *X*.
-   'Discourse on Metaphysics' part 9
    1.  **Principle of the Identity of the Indiscernables**: No two
        substances are exactly alike
        -   As far as there properties go, there are no two objects that
            at every level of granulaity are identical.
        -   God would have no reason to create two identicals.
        -   Leibniz believes that every proposition contains only
            concepts.
        -   Say that there is a *Y* that is identical to *X*, everything
            that can be said of *X* can be said of *Y*, except that *X*
            is not *Y*, but they're identical so this is equivilent to
            *X* is not *X*, which is a contradiction.

    2.  Substance begins only by creation and cease to exist only by
        annihilation
    3.  Substance cannot be divided into 2 substances or form by
        combining 2 substances.
    4.  **Mirroring thesis**: Each substance is a mirror of the universe
        and of god.
    5.  Each is bears in some way the character of god, wisdom, and
        power
        1.  Is analogous to god's perception of the infinite
        2.  Is such that every other is accommodating it.

### Notable paradoxes

-   If we know about an individual substance that has a complete
    concept, then certain things have to be true about everything that
    satisfy that concept.

February 18, 2013 - Reading: Excerpts from Leibniz's first two letters to Arnauld (May 1686; 14 July, 1686)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Remarks on Arnauld's Letter about My Proposition That the Individual Notion of Each Person Includes Once and for All Everything That Will Ever Happen to Him [May 1686]

-   Arnauld: god was free to create Adam or not, but assuming that he
    wanted to create him, everything that has happened to humankind had
    to happen, or ought to happen, by fatal necessity.
    -   Absolute and hypothetical necessity
    -   Arnauld is speaking only of hypotheical necessity

-   The other reply to this is that god is resolving to create Leibniz
    cannot fail to create a nature capable of thought.
-   Arnauld admits in good faith that what can be deduced from the
    notions of individual is the same process as deducing the notions of
    a spehere from its properties.

February 18th, 2013 - Lecture: Fatal necessity and the structure of the concept of an individual substance.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Leibniz's points:
    1.  When god creates Adam
        -   He does it determinately, and absolutely.
        -   When god creates Adam, it is part of a whole.

    2.  It's one thing to consider truths about kinds of things, it's
        abstract.
        -   Once you get an individual, there's one and only one thing
            which that concept can apply to.
        -   So, Adam, is completely individual and can be inditical to
            no other.
        -   This fits in to Leibniz's view of infinite analysis and
            identity.

    3.  Arnalud: Either the connection Adamn and Adam's posterity is
        intrinsicdependant of free decrees of god. Or the connection is
        intrinsic and necessary. (This bothers him because god would not
        have a choice.)
        -   If god creates Adam and god freely decrees certain laws and
            freely decrees certain particular events, then Adam's
            posterity exists.
        -   Leibniz stresses the connection between Adam and Adam's
            posterity, as it is "packed into" Adam.
        -   So you just look at the concept

-   Adam has a complete concept which contains all the predicates which
    are true of Adam and everything that happens after he dies, the
    connection between them contigent laws, but everything is there in
    the concept.
-   Argument, consider Adam-r
    -   There is no reasons to say Adam-r = Adam.
    -   So Adam is not identical to Adam-r

-   The original meaning of *a priori* was something you know from it's
    cause, it was in Leibniz's time which it became known as the "before
    senses" version.
-   **Super-esssentialism**: For all predicates *P*, if *i* is *P*, then
    necesarilly *i* is *P*.
-   **Moderate-essentialism**: For such predicates *P*, if *i* is *P*,
    then necesarilly *i* is *P* and for some predicates Q, if *i* is Q,
    necesarilly *i* is Q.
-   **Super-intrinsicalism**: If there were a thing *x* which differs in
    any predicate from *i*, *x* would not be equal to *i*.

February 20th, 2013 - Lecture: Critique of Descartes' doctrine of corporal substance, substantial forms, corporeal substances
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   This was written on the board, on page 85 of the reading. Where a
    C-body is a cartesian body.
    1.  Every C-body is composed of C-bodies, so a C-body is an
        aggregate.
    2.  An aggregate is a collection of things in some relation (its
        unity is in some way mental).
        -   Several things collected together as one thing.

    3.  An aggregate is real only if its constituents are true unities
        (substances).
    4.  So if an aggregate is composed of aggregates, which are
        composed of aggregates endlessly - the decomposition set
        contains nothing but aggregates, and it is unreal.
    5.  So a C-body is unreal.

-   Heaps of stones
    -   Classic example of vagueness
    -   Take one stone away, do you still have a heap of stones?
    -   Well, yeah, if it's big enough.
    -   But then what about if you do it again?
    -   And again?
    -   When you only have two?
    -   When you only have one?
    -   When you have none?

-   Bodies may be like heap of stones, indeterminate about their number.
-   Unless you can percieve something like substanial forms.
-   Either bodies are merely extended on par with rainbows and heaps, or
    they have substantial forms and souls.
-   What's wrong with material things that are extended?
-   Descartes maintains that bodies are subtances and are extended in
    three-dimensions.
    -   Minds are entirely different things.

-   A substance could have in its instance nothing but extension.
-   Descartes has an extremely difficult time explaining what a human
    being is.
-   "You've got some extension and you attach a human mind to it and you
    have a subtantial form."
-   Arnauld is a Cartesian, he think Descartes is right about the mind
    and body.
-   If a body is a substance, it has to be connected to a substantial
    form.
-   A soul is a substance, so it has to be connected to a substantial
    form.
-   In his second letter, Arnauld focuses on two questions:
    1.  World apart thesis
        -   The body can't have causal influence on the soul and vice
            versa

    2.  Something that's merely extended can't be a substance.
        -   A Cartesian body can't be a substance.
        -   Leibniz:

                soul = substantial form + body = substance

        -   He never refers to the soul as a simple substance.
        -   There is a kind of duality here, the soul as a substantil
            form.
        -   He points out that it satisfies the defintion.
            1.  Immaterial,
            2.  Not composed of parts,
            3.  Can't be destroyed,
            4.  Can't be corrupted
            5.  Contains all past and future states
            6.  All states of the universe

        -   Substances as parts of substances.
        -   What he calls substances on the right side of the formula
            above is "corporeal."
        -   He expressed uncertainty about what are corporeal.
        -   A block of marble is not substanial forms.
        -   Human beings have substantial forms, but animals may or may
            not.
        -   Intrinsic unity and **unity by accident**: individual things
            arranged in a useful way, dependant on relations.
        -   Every extended thing is divided into parts, which may or may
            not be seperated.
        -   Arnauld - **Substance**: A substance is an entity which is
            not a mode or state.
        -   Leibniz - The essense of an aggregate consists in modes or
            states of its constituents.
        -   So there are no aggregates unless there are substances,
            which are not aggregates.

### Leibniz on Expression

> I set out the relevant data for this project, including Leibniz's
> terse characterizations of expression, his examples of it, and, what
> is often neglected by those commentators who do explore the notion,
> his views about the role of expression in human reasoning.

#### Leibniz's Characterizations of Expression.

> I. That is said to express a thing in which there are relations that
> correspond to the relations of the thing expressed.

> II. One thing expresses another, when there is a constant and ordered
>     relation between what can be asserted of the one and what can be
>     asserted of the other.

> III. it is sufficient for the expression of one thing in another
>     [sufficit enim ad expressionem unius in alio] that there should be
>     a certain constant relational law, by which particulars in the one
>     can be referred to corresponding particulars in the other.

#### Leibniz's Examples of Expression

-   But these are too brief.
-   Leibniz's favorite example is the perspectival projection of a
    figure onto a plane. Examples:
    -   When a circle is projected onto an ellipse, the latter is an
        expression of the former
    -   In analytic geomtry, numbers and figures represent geometric
        figures.
    -   In algebra, numbers and figures represent magnitudes.
    -   A map expresses the geographical region that it depicts.
    -   A miniature model of a machine expresses the machine
    -   Perception is an expression of that which is perceived
        -   our ideas of color, warmth, and other sensory qualities are
            really expressions of the motions of minute figures

    -   General concepts express things.
        -   the idea of a circle expresses the circle itself

    -   Words express the things that they signify
    -   Numerals express numbers
    -   Speech expresses thought
    -   each monad expresses the entire universe

#### Leibniz on the Role of Expression in Human Reasoning.

> IV. What is common to all these expressions is that we can pass from a
>     consideration of the relations in the expression to a knowledge of
>     the corresponding properties of the thing expressed.

-   For example, the idea of a circle expresses a circle, and although
    it "is not similar to the circle, truths can be derived from it
    which would be confirmed beyond doubt by investigating a real
    circle"

> V. Characters are certain things by which the relationships among
> other things are expressed and which are easier to manage than the
> things themselves.

-   We need valid symbols to derive truths about what is smbolized.
-   This stems from the role of expression in Leibniz's philosophy.

> All of our reasoning is nothing but the combining and substitution of
> characters, whether those characters are words, marks, or even images

### Perspectival Projection As The Paradigm Of Expression

-   These explicit sources are not enough for inquiry.

#### Perspectival projections

> VI. Thus, a circle can be represented by an ellipse (that is, an oval
>     curve) in a perspectival projection, and indeed by a hyperbola,
>     which is most unlike it, and does not even return upon itself; for
>     to any point of the hyperbola a corresponding point of the circle
>     which projects the hyperbola can be assigned by the same constant
>     law.

-   And his response to Arnauld in passage (2) runs more fully:

> VII. One thing expresses another, in my language, when there is a con-
>     stant and ordered relation between what can be asserted of the one
>     and what can be asserted of the other. It is in this way that a
>     projec- tion in perspective expresses a geometric figure.

-   In *Theodicy*,

> VIII. There must always be an exact relation between the
>     representation and the thing [it expresses].... The projections in
>     perspective of the conic sections of the circle show that one and
>     the same circle may be represented by an ellipse, a parabola, a
>     hyperbola, and even another circle, a straight line and a point.

-   In *New Essays*,

> IXIV. ... [A]n ellipse, and even a parabola or hyperbola, has some
>     resem- blance to the circle of which it is a projection on a
>     plane, since there is a certain precise and natural relationship
>     between what is projected and the projection which is made from
>     it, with each point on the one corresponding through a certain
>     relation with a point on the other.

-   our sensory ideas express the motions of the particles that cause
    them,
-   **Correlating relation**: a relation that establishes such a
    correspondence.
    -   Like a **function**, a mapping of the points of the original
        figure to their counterparts in the figure that expresses it.
        Bijective.

#### The Method of Projection and Section.

-   Just like when an artist paints something, the representation being
    dependant on the angle of view, distorting the original form into
    something dependant on the viewer's capacity to be tricked,
    -   In the same way, an circle view obliquely is a ellipse.

-   For those paintings done in accordance with the rules of
    perspective, we have little trouble "being tricked."
    -   While some of the original is distorted, some of the original
        structure is also preserved, then.

-   So which of the original features is preserved and which of them are
    destroyed/distorted?
-   When Leibniz tells us that there is an "exact" or a "precise and
    natural" relation between the points of the two figures in a
    perspectival projection, he is also noting the much deeper relation-
    ship that holds between a conic section and its perspectival
    projections

#### Morals for an Account of Perspectival Expression

-   **Perspectival expression**: The expression of one geometrical
    figure by a perspectival projection of it onto another.
-   Features that are preserved by a transformation are said to be
    **invariant** under it.
-   Surrogative reasonging:

               1. Correlating relation
        R(a,b) ----------------------> R(a*, b*)
                     preserves R           | 
                                           | 2. Surrogative reasoning
                                           |
        3. Inverse of Correlating Relation v
        Q(b,a) ----------------------> Q(b*, a*)
                     preserves Q

-   Steps of **surrogative reasoning**:
    1.  We can encode information about the original situation as
        information about the relationships among the corresponding
        items in the expression. `a*` bears `R` to `b*`
    2.  Because information about the original relationships is pre-
        served by the corresponding relationships among items in the
        expression, much of the original information is also preserved
        by inferences about the constituents of the expression.
    3.  In a perspectival projection, preservation of structure runs
        both ways, and so we can make the return trip to a conclusion
        about relationships among the original items of interest.

#### An Account of Perspectival Expression

-   **Perspectival expression**: "the points in the original figure
    stand in a given projective relation (or have a given projective
    attribute) just in case the surrogates of those points in the
    expression stand in the counterpart of that relation (or have the
    counterpart of that attribute). Hence, the essential feature of a
    perspectival expression is that the pattern of projective relations
    and attributes among the constituents of the represented phenomena
    is mirrored by the pattern of such relations and attributes among
    the constituents of the expression of it."
-   In passage I, Leibniz tells us that one thing expresses a second
    when it contains "relations which correspond to the relations of the
    thing expressed."
-   In passage II, Leibniz tells us that one thing expresses another
    "when there is a constant and ordered relation between what can be
    asserted of the one and what can be asserted of the other."
-   In passage III, Leibniz tells us that it is sufficient for the
    expression of one thing in another that there be a "constant
    relational law, by which particulars in the one can be referred to
    corresponding particulars in the other."

### A General Account of Leibnizian Expression

-   This section provides:
    1.  A simple a natural generalization of Leibnizian expression
    2.  Shows how this account conforms with Leibniz's explicit
        characterizations
    3.  Explains how it relates to surrogative reasoning

#### Generalizing the Account of Perspectival Expression

-   A function, $\ast$, from the constituents of one thing, $O$,
    to those of a second, $E$, preserves the $n$-place relation
    $R^O$ of $O$ just in case, for each $n$-tuple of
    constituents $\lt X_1 ... X_n \gt$ of $O$:
    -   (PR) $R^O x_1 ... x_n $ if and only if $R^E x_1
        \ast ... x^ast_n $
    -   $R^E$ is the surrogate for the original relation $R^O$

-   Isomorphism is too much to expect from an expression
    -   For example, a circle does not have enough of it's relations
        preserved when projected into a parabola.
    -   Only those attributes that affect the truth value of what's
        being reasoned about matter.

-   Since one thing may have two different names, language is not a
    function.
    -   Perhaps expression if from the expression to the object, then.

-   Leibniz talks about an ideal language where things are onto,
    one-to-one.
-   The key to expression is *preservation of structure*, and not
    direction.
    -   one thing *expresses* a second just in case there is a
        structure-preserving mapping from either to the other.
    -   Consequences of this:
        -   one thing can express another even if they have only a
            little structure in common.
        -   figures that are not conic sections, e.g., squares, can
            express a circle, since there are mappings from the points
            of a square to those of a circle that preserve genuine
            relations
        -   does not require that the correlating relations in all
            expressions have these features (total, onto, one-to-one
            functions)

-   9 October, 1687, last responded letter to Arnauld
    -   It has always been a sideline for Arnauld.
    -   It's really Leibniz's business.
    -   At this point in time, he became preoccupied with his own
        affairs.
    -   Maybe he didn't find anything to respond to.
    -   Leibniz in 1688, wrote two more letters.
        1.  The right laws of motion, short letter
        2.  A final one going back to his metaphysical system

    -   This one does not introduce a lot that is new.

            "substantial form" + "body" = "aggregate of corporeal substances"

    -   You cannot have a whole real body unless it's parts are real.
    -   Each substantial form having a different concept
    -   You need to give reality to it's parts.
    -   Every body is composed of parts and every part has substantial
        forms and they consitute corporeal substances.
    -   Infinite corporeal substances.
    -   There can be no causal interaction between created substances.

-   The heap question
    -   There is no fact of the matter about it, no objective truth.
    -   Leibniz is saying put all of those substantial forms into the
        corporeal substance, see complete concept.
    -   We know that the complete concept of any substance of the
        substantial form has the reason that you have that identity to
        that substance at that time.
        -   Now that we have a substantial form that animates the
            corporeal substance

February 26th, 2013 - Reading: Leibniz's theory of expression and cognitive representation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   'That is said to express a thing in which there are relations
    [habitudines] which correspond to the relations of the thing
    expressed. But there are various kinds of expression; for example,
    the model of a machine expresses the machine itself, the projective
    delineation on a plane expresses a solid, speech expresses thoughts
    and truths, characters express numbers, and an algebraic equation
    expresses a circle or some other figure. What is common to all these
    expressions is that we can pass from a consideration of the
    relations in the expression to a knowledge of the corresponding
    properties of the thing expressed. Hence it is clearly not necessary
    for that which expresses to be similar to the thing expressed, if
    only a certain analogy is maintained between the relations. It is
    also clear that some expressions have a basis in nature, while
    others are arbitrary, at least in part, such as the expressions
    which consist of words or characters. Those which are founded in
    nature either require some similarity, such as that between a large
    and a small circle or that between a geographic region and a map of
    the region, or require some connection such as that between a circle
    and the ellipse which represents it optically, since any point
    whatever on the ellipse corresponds to some point on the circle
    according to a definite law. Indeed, a circle would be poorly
    represented by any other figure more similar to it in such a case.
    Similarly every entire effect represents the whole cause, for I can
    always pass from the knowledge of such an effect to a knowledge of
    its cause. So, too, the deeds of each one represent his mind, and in
    a way the world itself represents God. It may also happen that the
    effects which arise from the same cause express each other mutually,
    as for example, gesture and speech. So deaf people understand
    speakers, not by the sound, but by the motion of the mouth.' **'What
    is an Idea?' (1678) G 7.326-4; L 205T 2.**
    
    -  The model expresses the machine.
    -  The way that things are arranged.
    -  Some are natural, which means they depend on natural laws, or
       natural ways of thinking about things. 
       -  On the other hand, some correlate to signs and convetionality.
    
2.  'One thing expresses another (in my terminology) when there is a 
    constant and ordered relation between what can be said of the one 
    and what can be asserted of the other. This is the way that a perspectival
    projection experesses its ground-plan. Expression is common to all
    [substantial] forms, and it is a genus of which natural perception,
    animal sensation and intellectual knowledge are species. In natural
    perception and in sensation, it is enough for what is divisible and
    material and dispersed into many entities to be expressed or
    represented in a single indivisible entity or a substance which is
    endowed with true unity. . . . But this representation is
    accompanied by consciousness in the rational soul, and then it is
    called thought.' **Letter to Arnauld, 9 Oct. 1687; G 2.71, Mason,
    144**

2.  'It is sufficient for the expression of one thing in another that
    there should be a certain constant relational law, by which
    particulars in the one can be referred to corresponding particulars
    in another.' **'Metaphysical consequences of the Principle of
    Sufficient Reason' (1715), MP 176-7**
    -  There is a constant relational law betwen the constants.

3.  'It is true that the same thing may be represented in different
    ways; but there must always be an exact relation between the
    representation and the thing, and consequently between the different
    representations of one and the same thing. The projections in
    perspective of the conic sections of the circle show that one and
    the same circle may be represented by an ellipse, a parabola and a
    hyperbola, and even by another circle, a straight line and a point.'
    **Theodicy, 357 (1710); H 339**

4.  'The doctrine of shadows is simply that of perspective in reverse
    and results from it if we replace the eye by the luminous source,
    the object by the opaque body, and the projection by the shadow.'
    ?Precepts for Advancin the Sciences and Arts' **(1680), Leibniz
    Selections, Philip Wiener, 41**

5.  '. . . the simplicity of a substance does not prevent the plurality
    of modifications which must necessarily be found together in the
    same simple substance; and these modifications must consist in the
    variety of relations which the substance has with things outside. In
    the same way there may be found, in one centre or point, though it
    is perfectly simple, an infinity of angles formed by lines which
    meet in it.' **Principles of Nature and Grace (1714), AG 207**

6.  'There are successive perceptions, but there are also simultaneous
    ones, for, when there is a perception of the whole, at the same time
    there are perceptions of its actual parts, and it is even the case
    that each part has more than one modification. There is a perception
    all at once, not only of each modification, but also of each part.
    These perceptions, however much they are multiplied, are different
    from one another, even though our attention cannot always
    distinguish them, and that is what makes confused perceptions, of
    which each distinct one contains an infinity because of its relation
    to everything external. Finally, that which is composition of parts
    outside is represented only by the composition of modifications in
    the monad; without this, simple beings could not be distinguished
    internally from one another, and they would have no relation to
    external things.' **To Masson (1715); AG 228-9**

7.  'Each soul is a world in perspective, representing things outside
    according to its point of view, and confusedly or distinctly
    according to the organs that accompany it, . . . ' **To Sophie
    Charlotte (1706); G 7.566-7**

8.  '. . . although each created monad represents the whole universe, it
    represents more distinctly the body which is particularly affected
    by it and of which it is the entelechy. And as this body expresses
    the whole universe by the connection between all matter in the
    plenum, the soul also represents the whole universe in representing
    the body which belongs to it in a particular way.' **Monadology 61
    (1714); AG 221**

9.  'And since God's view is a always true, our perceptions are always
    true; it is our judgments, which come from ourselves, that deceive
    us.' **Discourse on Metaphysics, 14 (1686); AG, 47**

10. '[N]othing can limit [a monad] to representing only a part of
    things, though it is true that its representation is merely confused
    as to the details of the whole universe and can be distinct for a
    small part of things only . . . It is not in the object but in the
    modification of their knowledge of the object that the monads are
    limited. They . . . are limited and distinguished one from another
    by the degrees of their distinct perceptions.' **Monadology 60; AG
    220**

-   **Occasionalism**: Minds cause their states, but bodies are mostly 
    passive, causally inert. Some occasionalists, even mind cannot
    change themselves.
    -  [Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occasionalism) 
       **Occasionalism** is a philosophical theory about causation which
       says that created substances cannot be efficient causes of 
       events. Instead, all events are taken to be caused directly by 
       God.
- If you have a three dimensional scene,
  -  If you pick an angle from every point on the scene, draw a straight 
	   line.
  -  If you take a plane and "stick it between" the lines to your point,
	   you have a 2D representation of a 3D scene.
  -  It can be so good you think you're seeing the scene, and illusion.
-  These cases, expressions is a symettrical relation, if there is a 
   correspondence, there's going to be a reverse correspondence too.
   -  A lot of the examples of expressions Leibniz gives are not this
     strong.
   -  If you think of the combustion engine, there are going to be 
     features of the machine which will not be able to be expressed
     in the model.
   -  Very like loss of precision in computer science.
-  X is perceiving if and only if X is an individual substance and X
   expresses something material, divisible, and multitude.
-  There's a substantial form, your substantial form, which expresses
   perfectly the body that you animate.
-  Look a map expresses the territory it maps, no way that it cognizes
   the territory.
   -  I have true unity, which expresses this territory. According to 
      Leibniz, this cognizes the territory.
      
February 27th, 2013 - Short Paper Assignment
--------------------------------------------

The paper should be five pages in length (a little longer is acceptable)
Some topics to write about are suggested below. The suggestions are
starting points. You decide how you want to develop them. This may
involve narrowing or focusing the topic. Remember - you only have five 
pages for this. The paper must make a clear point or claim, and it
must make *a strong case* for this claim.

You may write on a topic not mentioned below provided that it involves
material we've discussed. Please consult with me before beginning to 
write on such a topic. Even if you choose one of the listed topics,
you may want to let me know how you intend to focus it.

1. According to Leibniz, there is no reason for doubting that God can 
form a concept of Adam so complete that everything that happens to Adam
and the Universe can be derived from it. 'It follows that he would not 
have been our Adam, but another, if he had experienced other events.'
('Remarks on Arnauld's Letter', etc., p. 73; G 2.42)
What is the reasoning by which Leibniz purports to show that this 
conclusion follows? Comment on the argument and/or consider some
implications, e.g. whether Adam could have refused the apple, whether
it is necessary that Adam took the apple.

2. Arnauld complained that Leibniz's argument that extension alone
is not sufficient to constitute a substance (*contra* Descartes'
account of corporeal substance) depends on an arbitrary definition on an
individual substance. Discuss the question whether or not this is a good
objection.

3. Corporeal substances have a claim to be true unities in part because
they are indestructible. Why is this important to Leibniz? Why do corporeal
substances have this property? Consider some implications regarding what
there is in the material world. You might consider, e.g., whether Leibniz
can explain the fact that in some species, a worm can be cut into two
and both half of it live; or, whether he can explain the fact that a cutting
taken from a pear tree and grafted onto an apple tree grows and produces
pears; or some other facts about living things. Do you think that the doctrine
of corporeal substances is in some way problematic?

March 4th, 2013 - Passages on relational predicates and the metaphysical status of relations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  "Therefore there seem to pertain to relations all the extrinsic
    denominations, i.e. those denominations which rise and perish
    without any change of the subject, simply because something changes
    in something else. Thus, a father becomes father as soon as his
    child is born, even though he, who happens to be in the East Indies,
    does not undergo any change. Thus, the similarity, which I share
    with someone else, is born and comes to light without any change in
    myself, but with a change in the other." A 6.4.308, tr. Mugnai

    NB: An "extrinsic denomination" of X is a predicate applied to X 
    from something else, Y; e.g. X is the father of Solomon; X is 
    greater than 3; X is similar to Plato.

2.  ". . . there are no extrinsic denominations, and no one becomes a
    widower in India by the death of his wife in Europe unless a real
    change occurs in him. For every predicate is in fact contained in
    the nature of a subject." A 6.4.1503 (1683-86?), tr. Mugnai

3.  "It follows further that there are no purely extrinsic denominations
    which have no foundation at all in the denominated thing itself. For
    the concept of the denominated subject necessarily involves the
    concept of the predicate. Likewise, whenever the denomination of a
    thing is changed, some variation has to occur in the thing itself."
    "Primary Truths" (1689?), L 268
	-   Leibniz is tying that there are no extrinsic denominations to
		the concept containment theory of truth.
	-   Titius expresses everything in the Universe, including "having
		son" at moment one not at "moment two."
4.  Philalethes-Locke: ". . . a change of relation can occur without
    there having been any change in the subject. . . [Titius, who is
    today a father] ceases to be so tomorrow, only by the death of his
    son, without any alteration made in himself." Theophilus-Leibniz:
    "That can very well be said if we are guided by the things of which
    we are aware; but in metaphysical strictness there is no wholly
    extrinsic denomination (denominatio pure extrinseca), because of the
    real connection of things." NE 227 (1702-04)

5.  "In addition to the substances, which are the underlying objects,
    there are the modifications of the substances, which are subject to
    creation and destruction in their own right. And finally, there are
    the relations, which are not created in their own right but result
    from the creation of other things." Notes on Temmik (1715-16),
    Massimo Mugnai, Leibniz" Theory of Relations, 155, tr. Mugnai

6.  "It may be that dozen and score are merely relations and exist only
    with respect to the understanding. The units are separate and the
    understanding takes them together, however scattered they may be.
    However, although relations are the work of the understanding they
    are not baseless and unreal. The primordial understanding is the
    source of things; and the very reality of all things other than
    simple substances rests only on the foundation of the perceptions or
    phenomena of simple substances." NE 145

7.  "Relations and orderings are to some extent beings of reason,
    although they have their foundations in things; for one can say that
    their reality, like that of eternal truths and possibilities, comes
    from the Supreme Reason." NE 227

8.  "The reality of relations is dependent on mind, as is that of
    truths; but they do not depend on the human mind, as there is a
    supreme intelligence which determines all of them from all time." NE
    265

### 'Meditation on the Principle of the Individual' (1676)

-   Someone who understands an effect perfectly will also understand the
    cause of that effect.
    -   In this way, an effect involves its cause.
    -   There is a necessary connection between a complete cause and the
        effect.
    -   There is an obstacle however! Consider the argument:
        1.  Whether two parallelograms or two triangles are put together,
            it will always produce the *same* square.
        2.  Neither square can be distinguished from the other square.
        3.  Therefore, not all complete causes have a 1 to 1 relation,
            they're not functions.
    -   Leibniz solves this problem by raising the point of how no two
        objects in his metaphysics can be identical.
        -   There will be some difference that retains the mind of the
            method in which change was produced.
        -   This can be discerned.
-   This argument proves that matter is *not* homogenous.
    -   Our inmost mind is present both to itself and to matter,
        therefore nothing can be introduced to them which cannot be
        understood by us in some way.

### 'Substance and Individuation in Leibniz', Cover and Hawthorne, pp. 184-99

March 4th, 2013 - Lecture
-------------------------

-   To have a position in space is to exist at a particular distance
    from other things in time. 
-   What Leibniz says about relations in general holds true for spatial
    and temporal positions.
-   The soul of Alexander expresses everything in the Universe, and we
    now know what this means.
-   What's a relation? 
    -   Non-identity is a relation
-   Two issues:
    1.   What is the metaphysical status?
    2.   Something.
-   Near the end of Leibniz's life, there was a famous discussion about
    space.

### Relations

-   **A relational predicate**: $P$ is a relational predicate of $S$ if $P$ implies 
	1.  That something other than $S$ exists.
	2.  That thing (1) have a certain relation to $S$.
-   The motivation for the complete concept containment is from Aristotle.
	-   That something that is predicated on something individually cannot
	    be predicated on anything else.
	-   Substances
-   The thought is that there are nine categories of axioms.
-   Of the nine, they cannot exist unless they exist in some substance.
-   Another part of Aritstotle's doctrine is that some accident must exist
    in some substance, must exist in only one.
-   An **accident**: 
	-   Aristotle: A thing that is said of or exists in another.
	-   Leibniz: Somethings that is predicated on another.
-   If you get the complete concept of an individual, the predicates of the 
    individual are unique to that individual.
-   Accidents:
	1. Quantity
	2. Quality
	3. Relations
	4. Dispositions
-   Aristotle says a couple of interesting things about relations
	1.  A relation, unlike quality or quality, is an eccident of a particular subject,
	    but it is directed to another subject, so it implies the exist of another.
		-   "Of" something or "than" something
		-   "Towardness"
	2.  A subject that has a relation can cease to have that relation without anything
	    happening to that subject.
		-   Socrates is taller than Simius, and then he is shorter than Simius,
		    but nothing has happened to Socrates.
		-   A thing can undergo a change with regards to its relational accidents
			without anything happening to that thing.
		-   Cambridge change
		-   No strictly extrinsic denominations
-   This shouldn't come as a surprise (no extrinsic denominations)
-   You can go from knowledge of the expression, you can learn truths about
	the things expressed.
	-   Provided you know the relations to be preserved are.
-   There are two parts to the relation,
	1.  The soul expresses perfectly the S-body.
		-   The body is surrounded perfectly by the S-body
-   The connection of all things is spatial continuity
-   When the son of Titius dies, there is something in Titius' soul which
    expresses that change.
-   Leibniz denies that space is anything but an ordering relation
-   He agrees with Newton's empirical evidence for absolute acceleration.
	-   But not absolute space and time.
-   Leibniz holds that space is relation of order
	-   What are we talking about when we talk about space?
		-   We observe that many of the things that exist at the same time
			have an order of coexistence.
		-   Say we have bunch of bodies that are simulteanosly existing,
			and some of them, maintain the same distances from each other.
			
March 11th, 2013 - Short Paper Assignment: Leibniz, Corporeal Substances, and Biology
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The breadth and precision of the work of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz is
astonishing. Writing between the mid-1650s and early 1700s, Leibniz’s
vast contributions to mathematics and philosophy are overwhelming. As an
early modern, Leibniz wrote just on the cusp of the bulk of the
Scientific Revolution. There are accepted scientific discoveries taught
to every child of the 21st Century that Leibniz never had access to. As
a consequence of this, Leibniz’s theory could not have been conceived
with many of what are now prominent scientific theories in mind. It is
impossible to determine how Leibniz would have accommodated or changed
his system had he known of the tremendous advances humanity has made
since his time, but it perfectly possible to see how his theory stands
against new knowledge. A quality of a good theory is being able to
predict and account for new information. Leibniz’s conception of
corporeal substances is of particular interest to this endeavor, as much
has been discovered since Darwin about the nature of humankind and their
animal, plant, and bacterial co-inhabitants. Leibniz developed a system
to explain what it meant to be alive, to be animated, and why humankind
appear to be different from other life 100 years before the fundamental
theory of biology, evolution by natural select, had been seriously
proposed. It was many hundred more before it was widely accepted and
explored by the scientific community and the public. There are facts
about the natural world which integrate nicely into Leibniz’s thought,
but there are also facts and theories which stand in direct conflict
with Leibniz’s view. Leibniz is renowned for his lifelong attempts at
the irenicism of Catholicism and Protestantism, and in similar spirit,
this paper will set out to point out and reconcile the differences in a
modern understanding of science and biology with Leibniz’s conception of
corporeal substance.

In order to explore Leibniz on corporeal substance, one must begin with
an understanding of his account of substance. This begins with Leibniz’s
Concept Containment Theory of Truth, that is, that a true proposition is
a predicate which contains within it the concept of the subject. From
this, Leibniz concludes that something is a substance if and only if its
concepts contains the basis and reason for everything that can be truly
said of that thing. This means that it contains all predicates which
could possibly be said of that thing in the past, present, and future.
This leads Leibniz to the following conclusions about substances:

1.  No two substances are exactly alike (Principle of the Identity of
    the Indiscernables);

2.  Every substance begins only by creation and cease to exist only by
    annihilation;

3.  No substance can be divided into 2 substances or be formed by
    combining 2 substances;

4.  Every substance is a mirror of the universe and of God (Mirroring
    Thesis); and

5.  Every substance bears in some way the character of god, wisdom, and
    power

It is from this platform that one can understand Leibniz’s criticism of
Cartesian corporeal substance. Leibniz holds that Cartesian bodies,
Descartes’ account of corporeal substance, are unreal. Because every
Cartesian body (C-body) is composed of C-bodies, Leibniz holds, a C-body
is an aggregate. An aggregate can only be real if it’s components are
real, but a C-body contains nothing but aggregates. Therefore, C-bodies
are unreal. This means bodies are examples of vagueness for Leibniz,
just like heaps of stones.

To solve this, Leibniz uses souls. The soul is the substance formed when
when a substantial form and a body have true unity (as opposed to the
accidental unity of rainbow and bodies). Leibniz points out that souls
meet the definition for substances, as they are immaterial, not composed
of parts, cannot be destroyed, cannot be corrupted, they contain all
past and future states, and all states of the universe. He states that
human beings definitely have substantial forms, but he is unsure about
other animals. This is important for Leibniz because God needs a
timeless way to discern and plan the course of the entire universe from
every given substance, and bodies are vague and not timeless.

Armed with a crash course in the metaphysical status of bodies in
Leibniz, the reader is prepared to analyze some facts discovered some
facts about biology since Leibniz’s death. There is at least one
discovery which Leibniz would likely rejoice in!

One-hundred trillion. That’s the number of bacteria present in every
human in what is known as the “human micro biome.” The Stanford
microbiologist Dr. David Relman says that humans are “like coral” in
that they are an “an assemblage of life-forms living together.” There
are ten times more bacterial cells in humans than human cells (the
latter are much bigger). Every human has one to two and half *kilograms*
of bacterial mass at any given time. Dr. Relman adds that it’s
“humbling” (Kolata). This is a perfect example of how C-bodies are
unreal in the metaphysical sense, and how they may be very like rainbows
and heaps of rocks. It would be consistent with Leibniz’s point to ask a
question like, is a human without a micro biome still human? The answer
is, of course, intuitively quite obvious, but clearly become
increasingly problematic. This supports Leibniz because it makes
physical bodies vague aggregates, which require some metaphysical
grounding.

But using this as evidence for Leibniz’s claims is problematic.
Leibniz’s claim is that C-bodies are infinitely divisible, yet there is
a fairly rigid definition of what is “alive” in biology. Cells are
considered to be the “atom” in biology, where those sub-cellular parts
that make a cell are not considered to be a living things on their own.
A defender of Leibniz would respond that cells are, in fact, easily
divisible. Cells are composed of 20 amino acids, five nucleotide bases,
a few sugars, and some lipids (McKay); and that the parts not being
alive is irrelevant, cells are still infinitely divisible. This type of
argument is forever at the risk of committing “god of the gaps”-type
argument from ignorance fallacy, where Leibniz’s opponent respond that
these components actually have some other finite indivisibility, be it
atoms, sub-atomic particles, quantum bosons, photons ... This argument,
however, is one which Leibniz’s metaphysical theory can be said to have
predicted. Leibniz is right, and consistent with the evidence, bodies
are vague. But Leibniz may be mistaken that bodies are *infinitely*
divisible.

There is a technique in horticulture known as “grafting,” and it
involves taking vascular tissue from one plant and inserting it into
another plant so that they may form one plant. It is used when one plant
has a desirable roots and trunk, and another plant with desirable stem,
leaves, flowers, or fruits. It’s useful because a farmer can, for
instance, take advantage of the fast growing qualities of one plant and
the pretty flowers or tasty fruit of another. There are many other uses,
ranging from repair to improving sturdiness to as a mere curiosity
attraction (Hottes).

This is relevant to Leibniz because he holds that no substance can be
divided into two or combined to form one. Leibniz also holds that any
given substance can only come into being by creation. Perhaps for plants
this is easily written off as, well, plants must not have substantial
forms. It is intuitive, though not clear, that plants do not warrant
souls. This would mean that grafting is not the combining or dividing of
substances, and becomes unproblematic.

What happens as the argument moves closer to humankind, who Leibniz
explicitly says have substantial forms, souls, and corporeal substance.
Sponges are animals which do not have nervous, digestive, or circulatory
systems, instead they rely on water to distribute nutrients and remove
waste. Unlike all plants, sponges share the same kingdom as humankind:
Animalia. And they have this curious way of reproducing. They can “bud”,
an asexual means of reproducing where fragments of the animal fall off
by means of being hit by a wave or akin, and those fragments go on to
form an entirely distinct sponge (Ruppert, E. E., Fox, R. S., and
Barnes, R. D.). This is a problem for Leibniz because sponges are
animals which share many characteristics with humans, and if they are
granted souls or substance, then it would be the case that a substance
could be formed from the division of another.

But perhaps even though sponges are animals, they are still too simple
to warrant souls. A defender of Leibniz may say that while sponges are
classified zoologically as being similar to humans, there are relevant,
explicit differences in complexity that distinguish sponges from
humanity. From this, there are rational bases for believe that humankind
have substantial forms while sponges do not. What is worrying about this
for Leibniz is that it’s possible to move all the way up the tree of
life and find instances of what appears to be substances being created
by division of existing substances. Leibniz’s definition of substance
has to answer to a growing list of asexual reproduction in and out of
the animal kingdom, e.g. the splitting of worms, Timema insects using
solely asexual reproduction for (evidently) millions of years,
parthenogenesis in hammerhead sharks, the list grows.

But even if the critics of Leibniz grant that human beings are
absolutely unique in all of life on Earth in being complex enough to
warrant having substantial form, there are still problems. The primary
means of explaining the complexity of life on Earth is the fundamental
theory of biology, which is change over time by means of natural
selection. This process implies two things: (1) There must have been
some point of creation, which formed the substance on which change over
time operated on, and (2) That there was some point in natural history
in which the life that was to be humans did not have the prerequisite
complexity to warrant substantial form. Leibniz theory of souls works if
the story described in Genesis is assumed. Working under the premise of
the modern understanding of science, a Leibnizian needs to be able to
describe how a soul could be “gained” or “injected” into a sufficiently
complex life form, after a long period of development.

Everything in the Universe contains marks and traces of everything else
in the Universe, Leibniz holds. And on the subject of life on Earth,
modern science corroborates his claim, as all creatures share the same
language of life, DNA. Furthermore, a modern understanding of science
would confirm Leibniz’s claims about the vagueness of bodies, in that it
is unclear at what point one has a body and when one does not have a
body. What needs explaining, however, is how this shared heritage can be
while humankind remain unique in having substantial form. It is a
testament to Leibniz’s genius that hundreds of years of rapid
advancement of science and understanding of the natural world have not
vanquished his theory. Instead, his system raises perplexing questions
which inspire further research in both philosophy and natural science.

-   You could have two identical things different in space and time and
    that would be enough to make them different.
-   Nothing ever changes unless some intrinsic change in everything in 
    the universe has a mark and trace of the change.
-   Every individual substance expresses the whole Universe.
    -   It contains a "pointer."
-   Spatial and temporal relations have relations.
-   You can't get things in different spaces in different times unless
    you have something to put them there.
-   There's something in each of those things that makes them in those
    times and places.
-   PII: Often he argues from the PSR
    -   Two ways to go from PSR to PII:
        1.  Look again at the argument in the third letter that Leibniz
            wrote to Clarke
-   Newton and Clarke think space has an absolute frame of reference
    -   Clarke thinks the material world is finite
     
                            N
                x+--------+  y+--------+ 
                 |possible|   |possible|
                 |world a |   |world b |  
               W +---+    |   |   +----+ E
                     |    |   |   |
                     |    |   |   |
                     +----+y  +---+x
                            S
   
    -   God would have no means to prefer a to b, therefore
        space cannot be absolute by PSR.
    -   **Divine preference argument**: If there indiscernables in the 
        actual world, then there is another possible world where they
        are switched. God could have no reason to choose one rather than
        the other. But PSR.
-   **No Reason Argument**: There is no reason for saying that $A$ and $B$
    are individually different, so they aren't individually different. Objections:
    1.  Why couldn't it run the other way around?
    2.  The mere fact that something has no reason is not enough to
        suggest something. Perhaps there is no fact of the matter,
        no objective truth.
-   Premises
    1. PSR
    2. Exactly alike
    3. Sufficnient reason to say alike
    4. No possible differences
