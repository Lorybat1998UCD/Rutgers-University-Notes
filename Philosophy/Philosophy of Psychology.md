Topics in Philosophy of Psychology <small>with Professor Frances Egan</small>
=============================================================================

Syllabus
--------

### Course Description

The topic of the seminar is psychological explanation. We will focus on
two issues: (1) The role of representation in psychological explanation,
considering recent challenges – by (among others) proponents of
extended, embodied, and enactive cognition – to the traditional view
that psychological processes are to be understood as operations on
symbol structures. We will consider the requirements for a theoretical
construct to count as a representation, and whether there are any
distinctively mental representations. (2) The relation of psychology to
neuroscience, considering the recent challenge – by proponents of the
so-called 'new mechanism' view in philosophy of science – to the view
that psychological explanation of human cognitive capacities (in
particular, computational explanations of cognitive capacities) can be
constructed and confirmed independently of an account of how these
capacities are realized in the brain. The new mechanists argue that
genuine explanations of cognition are mechanistic explanations – they
must bear a transparent relationship to accounts of realizing neural
mechanisms.

### Psychosemantics <small>Jerry Fodor</small>

#### Chapter 1 <small>The Persistence of Attitudes</small>

##### Introduction

-   Quotes *A Midsummer Night's Dream* for an example of implicit,
    nondemonstrative, theoretical evidence.
-   Here is how the inference must have gone:
    -   Hermia had reason to believe herself beloved of Lysander.
        -   Because he told her.

    -   If Lysander loves Hermia, then Lysander wishes Hermia well.
    -   If Lysander wishes Hermia well, then Lysander does not voluntarily
        desert Hermia in the night in the woods.
    -   But Hermia was deserted by Lysander.
    -   Therefore, not voluntarily. 
    -   Therefore, it is plausible Lysander has come to harm, and plausibly
        by Demetrius's hands, for Demetrius is Lysander's rival for the love
        of Hermia.

-   Hermia believes (correctly) that: If *x* wants that *P*, and *x* believes
    that not-*P* unless *Q*, and *x* believes that *x* can bring about *Q*,
    then (ceteris paribus) *x* tries to being it about that *Q*.
-   But Hermia has it wrong about Demetrius.
    -   The intricate theory that she relies on to make sense of her
        peers, that we rely on to make sense of Hermia, and what Shakespeare
        relies on to predict and manipulat our sympathies.

-   This theory, Fodor wants to emphasize:
    1.  How often it goes right,
    2.  How deep it is,
    3.  How much we do depend on it.

##### How often it works

-   Applications of commonsense mediate our relations with one another,
    and when its predictions fail these relations break down.
    -   Failures make for great theater.
    -   Succeses are practically invisible and ubiquitous.

-   Commonsense psychology is like those mythical Rolls Royce cars whose
    engines are seals when they leave the factory.
    -   Someone I don't know calls me and asks me to lecture in Arizone
        on Tuesday.
    -   Fodor responds, "Yes, thank, I'll be at your airport on the 3 p.m.
        flight."
    -   That's *all* that happens.
        -   The theory is used to gap the bridge betwen utterances and
            actions.
        -   If Fodor doesn't show it, the theory makes predicts about the
            likelihood of why.

-   The point is that the theory from which we get this extrodinary predictive
    power is just good old commonsense belief/desire psychology.
    -   It tells us how to infer people's intentions from the sounds they
        make.
    -   It tells us how to infer people's behavior from their intentions.
    -   And all of this works on your friends and your spouses and absolute
        strangers.

-   But what about all those ceteris paribuses?
    -   Philosophers love the "false or vacuous" dilemma.

-   Consider the defeasibility of "if someone utters the form of words, 'I'll
    be at your airport on the 3 p.m. flight,' then he intends to be at
    your aiport on the 3 p.m. flight."
    -   This generalization does *not* hold if:
        -   The speaker is lying,
        -   Monoligual speaker of Urdu who uttered by accident,
        -   If the speaker is talking in his sleep,
        -   Or ... whatever.

    -   Perhaps all that this means with a *ceteris paribus* clause is,
        if it doesn't happen, then it still true because *ceteris paribus*.

-   A lot of philosophers are moved by this.
    -   But the predictions often come out true!
        -   So how could it be *empty*?

-   The reliance on uncashed *ceteris paribus* clauses is a general property
    of the *explicit* generalizations in *all* the special sciences.
    -   For example, "A meandering river erodes its outside bank"
        -   False or vacuous a philosopher may complain.

    -   A *ceteris paribus* clause here cause "If *p* then *q* unless not
        *p* then *q*."

-   Something must have gone wrong, surely this explanation is meaningful
    despite the big *ceteris paribus* clause.
    -   Surely these statements are stronger than "*P* in any world where not
        not-*P*."

-   There is a face similarity between implicit generalizations and
    commonsense psychology and explicity generalization in special sciences.
    -   We can get rid of the *ceteris paribus* clauses by *actually
        enumerating* the conditions.

-   By this criterion, the only real science is basic physics.
    -   We can't enumarate all the conditions on geology by sticking to
        the vocabulary of geology.
    -   The events in the *ceteris paribus* clause about the rivers aren't
        geological events, it's outside the domain. (Also hard.)

-   Exceptions to generalizations of a special science are typically
    inexplicable from the point of view of that science.
    -   This is what makes it *special*.
    -   It's possible to enumerate them in the vocaubalry of another
        science.
        -   You go "down" one or more levels and use the vocabulary of
            the more "basic" science.

-   If the world is describable at all in a closed causal system, it
    is with vocabulary of the most basic science.
    -   But the psychologist and the geologist needn't worry about this.
    -   If you want to know where Fodor will be next Thursday, mechancins is
        *no use to you at all*.

##### The depth of the theory

-   It's tempting to think that commonsense psychology is a toolkit of
    truisms one learns on Granny's knee.
    -   Like,
        -   The burnt child fears the fire.
        -   Money cannot buy happiness.
        -   Reinforcment affect response rate.
        -   A way to a man's heart is through his stomach.

    -   None of these are worth save, but commonsense psychology is not like
        this.
    -   There are two parts to this:
        1.  The theory's underlying generalizations are defined over 
            unobservables.
        2.  They lead to its predictions by iterating and interacting rather
            than being directly instantiated.

-   Behavior is casued by mental states and this causation is intricate.
    -   Roughly, *If x is y's rival, the x prefers y's discomfiture, all else
        being equal*.
        -   Doesn't mention behavior.
        -   It *leads to* behvaioral predictions.

-   It is a deep fact about the world that the most powerful etiological
    generalizations hold of unobservable causes.
    -   Meterology is *not* deep because it's genralization are of the form,
        "Red at night, sailors delight."
    -   Psychology *is* a deep theory, because we do not have access to mental
        states.
        -   We're born mentalisms and realists, and we stay that way until
            common sense is driven out by bad philosophy.

##### Its indispensability

-   We have no alternative to the vocabulary of commonsense psychological
    explanation.
    -   There is no other way of describing our behaviors and their causes
        if we want our behaviors and their causes to be subsumed by any
        counterfactual-supporting generalizations that we know about.

-   Without commonsense psychological generalizations, we cannot even describe
    the utterances as forms of words.
    -   Word is a *psychological* category.
    -   There are non acoustic properties that all and only *fully intelligble*
        tokens of the same word type share.
        -   Which is why our best technology cannot build a typewriter you can
            dictate to.

-   We have *no* vocabulary for describing event types with these conditions:
    1.  My behvior in uttering, "I'll be there on Thursday" counts as an
        event of type $T_i$.
    2.  My arriving there on Thursday counts as an event of type $T_j$.
    3.  'Events of type $T_j$ are consequent upon events of type $T_i$' is
        even roughly true and counterfactual supporting.
    4.  Categories $T_i$ and $T_j$ are other than irreducibly psychological.

-   Physics describes organisms *qua* motions, but not *qua* organismic.
    -    It dissolves the behav*er* and the behav*ior* into atoms in the void.

-   Even if psychology was dispensible *in principle*, it's not argument for
    dispensing with it *in practice*.

###### The essence of the attitudes

> How do we tell whether a psychology *is* a belief/desire psychology?
> How, in general, do we know if propositional attitudes are among the
> entities that the ontology of a theory acknowledges? ...
> How do you distinguish elimination from reduction and reconstruction?

-   Fodor will view psyhology as being commensensical about the attitudes
    just in case it postulates states satisfying:
    1.  Thy are semnatically evaluable.
    2.  The have causal powers.
    3.  The implicit generalizations of commonsense belief/desire psychology
        are largely true of them.

> Squabbling about intuitions strikes me as vulgar.

###### RTM

-   **Thesis**: We have no reason to doubt - indeed, we have substantial
    reason to believe - that it is possible to have a scientific psychology
    that vindicates commonsense belief/desire explanation.
-   Fodor will argue that the sorts of objections philosophers have recently
    raised against belief/desire explanation are not conclusive against the
    best vindicating theory currently available.
-   At the heart of RTM is the postulation of a LOT, an infinite set of
    'mental representations' which function both as immediate objects of
    propositional attitudes and as the domains of mental processes.
-   The two claims he's making:
    1.  **The nature of propositional attitudes**:
        -   For any organism *O*, and any attitude *A* towards the proposition
            *P*, there is a (computational/functional) relation *R* and a 
            mental representation *MP* such that:
            -   *MP* means that *P*.
            -   *O* has *A* just in case *O* bears *R* to *MP*.
    
    2.  **The nature of mental processes**:
        -   Mental processes are causal sequences of tokenings of mental
            representations.

-   A train of thought is a causal sequence of tokenings of mental 
    representations which express the propositions that are the
    objects of the thoughts.
-   RTM underlies practicaly all current psychological research on mentation,
    and the best science is ipso fact the best estimate of what there is
    and what it's made of.
    -   Philosophers do not think this convincing, and Fodor is blushing for
        them.

> There is a stricking parallelism between the causal relations among
> mental states, on the one hand, and the semantic relations that hold
> among propositional objects, on the other.

-   Trains of thought are largely truth preserving[^4].
-   The "trick" is to combine the postulation of mental representations
    with the "computer metaphor."
    -   Computers show us how to connect semantics with causal properties
        for symbols.
        -   If having propositional attitude involves tokening a symbol, then
            we can get some leverage on connection semantical properties with
            causal ones for *thoughts*.

### On representation

-   Advanced "beings" like us have evolved with our environment, this is
    with representation.
    -   These somehow causally affect behavior.
    -   This is an "inference to the best explanation."

-   To the degree which organisms can react to a changing circumstance
    causes the representation to change, and the changed representations
    change behavior.
-   Some people think that dynamic behavior requires
    representationalism.

Representation
:   A capacity of an organism.

Representation*s*
:   Concrete objects in the brain.

:   Some properties: - Physically realized. - They have causal powers,
    can have straightforward causal roles.

    -   They have content, they are meaningful.
        -   This requires a distinction between a vehicle of
            representation, they thing physically realized.

-   Vision resonates with the environment like a tuning fork. Gibson's
    theory of perception.
-   Our brains or us might have the structure for representations, but
    we can't "poke at" any representation.
-   One way that representat*ion* could get cached out is
    *dispositionally*.
    -   Some theories might posit capacities that are best characterized
        as *representational*.
    -   There might not be an isolable state at the computational level
        that's like, "There's the representation!"
        -   A real property of an organism, but diffuse.
        -   Like mass.

-   Many theories posit something analogous to "sentences in the head."
    -   But there are other models of cognition.
        -   Connectionist
        -   Dynamical

### Vehicle-side

Symbols
:   Little hooks on which you can hook meaning. Ripe for having content
    attributed to them, representation paradigmatically.

Connectionists models
:   Don't posit anything like "sentences in the head." The carriers of
    meaning are networks of nodes that are connected in various ways. Do
    get interpreted, but do individual nodes get interpreted? *That*
    node refers to red *in a network*.

:   Typically are not construed as a strong representational view.

Dynamical models
:   Model the behavior of the system over time.

-   What are the *vehicles* of meaning in non-symbol cognitive models?
    -   Is there anything in here that could be plausible construed as a
        representation?

-   In classical models, what the vehicles of representation are,
    symbols are hooks on which to hang interpretation. Waving red flags,
    interpret me.

### Content-side

-   Content has satisfaction conditions.

-   The problem of intentionality: How do mental states *get* their
    meaning? What is it about mental representations that given them
    their meaning or content.
    -   Public representation
        -   Public language content get their meaning by convention.
        -   Icons and images get meaning by their resemblance and
            convention.

    -   Private representation
        -   Some relation that isn't *already presuming* meaning or
            intentionality.
        -   The "meaning in the head" or "state of affairs" which it
            representations, **the naturalism semantics project**.
        -   "Complex causal relations" represented in my head.
        -   Teleological function of the brain, dealing with objects and
            properties I'm used, and my ancestors are, used to.

-   No one has be successful in naturalistic conditions on vehicle in
    the head having determinate content.
-   One constraint on all of these account is that mental states can not
    only *represent* but also *mis*represent.
    -   The contrast is with Grice's notion of natural meaning.
        -   The presence of smoke cannot misrepresent the presence of
            fire *unless* an agent misinterprets the smoke or something.

### Strong representationalism

Strong representationalism
:   Posits structure entities that have content.

:   Mental processes are defined over the structures.

-   An important issue: is there anything in non-representational views
    that could count as a vehicle.

Extended cognition
:   The mind extends into the environment in some sense.

:   The extended thesis is not centrally a critique of
    representationalism, but it does have theses that bring to bear on
    representationalism.

Embodied cognition
:   Human cognition is necessarily embedded, the mind-brain is the
    executive that controls the body.

Dynamical cognition
:   Cognition consists in a dynamical interaction between a subject and
    an environment, and it's wrong to characterize the interaction as
    contentful.

### Jerry Fodor's "Psychosemantics"

-   He gives two arguments for the view known as "representational
    theory of mind."
    -   Folk psychology is indispendable.
        -   The only way to vindicate it is if something like RTM is
            true.

    -   Eliminativism would be an absolute disaster.

-   The second is the striking parrallelism between trains of thought
    and inferences.
-   The argument focuses on prediction, the only way to get around in
    the world is to ask someone something and predict that, in general,
    you do what you say and similar elsewhere.
-   Intentional realism is the only appropriate attitude to take towards
    folk psychology.

Intentional realism
:   1.  They are semantically evaluable.
    2.  They have causal powers.
    3.  The implicit generalizations of commonsense belief/desire
        psychology are largely true of them.

RTM
:   The best hope for realizing intentional realism.

:   1.  For any organism O, and any attitude A toward the proposition P,
        there is a ('computational'/'functional') relation R and amental
        representation MP such that MP means that PI and O has A iff O 
        bears R to MP.
    2.  Mental processes are causal sequences of tokenings of mental 
        representations.

:   There are representation in a full-blooded sense.

-   If the LOT is true for propoisitonal attitudes, then the RTM is true
    because it's the weaker view.
    -   There's a big project on mental logic.

-   Oftentimes, people's reason doesn't follow logic.
    -   People will more often affirm the consequent, more common
        in mental reasoning than *modus tollens*.

-   "I believe there is beer in the refridgerator."
    -   What was causally efficaious was that I wanted beer
        and believed there was beer, so I got up to get beer.
    -   This is the "belief box."[^3]

-   There has to be a pretty good argument for the moving from
    property of one structure to the structure of the other.
    Specifically, they share semantics, but we need a good argument
    about syntax. Moving from the logical scheme to the empirical
    scheme.
    -   An argument *for this* is the tempurature case.

-   **We'll pick up next time with the Dennett counter-example.**

February 4th, 2014 <small>Seminar</small>
-----------------------------------------

### On Fodor's *Psychosemantics*, Chapter 1 "The Persistence of Attitudes"

-   Fodor is looking for a theory for states that interprets attitudes as
	states with propositions, beliefs and desires *at least*.
	-   Chomsky: "We *cognize* the grammar of English."
	-   "We *believe* the grammar of our language."

-   This is the "last gasp" of narrow content for Fodor.
-   On Dennet's counterexample.
    -   There is a distinction between core and derivative.
        -   Those that *explicitly* represented and those that are 
            *implicitly* represented.
        -   Our heads just aren't big enough.

February 11th, 2014 <small>Reading</small>

### Zenon Pylyshyn. "The Explanatory Role of Representation"

#### Introduction

-   The hardest puzzle is consciousness.
    -   Second hardest is *meaning*, which this work explains.
    -   Does *not* solve the puzzle of meaning.
    -   The author aims to **describe how the idea of the semantic
        content of representations is implicitly viewed within the field
        of cognitive science, and discuss why this view is
        justifiable**.

Representations
:   Generalizations stated over the contents of representations are not
    mere functional generalization in the usual sense.

Function generalizations
:   A theory that does not refer to physical properties of the
    particular system in question, only how it operates.

-   There will be a *representational level* and a *symbol-processing
    level*.

#### The Appeal to Representations

-   Law-like generalization and explanations can differ in several ways,
    consider:
    1.  A certain object accelerated at *a* meters per second per second
        because a steady force was applied that was equal to *ma*.
    2.  A certain neuron fired because a potential of *v* millivolts was
        applied along two of its sentries and that it had been inactive
        during the previous *t* milliseconds
    3.  A bit pattern of certain computer register came to have a
        particular configuration because of the particular contents
        present in the instruction register and the program counter, and
        because the system is wired according to a certain transfer
        protocol.
    4.  The computer printed numbers 2, 4, 6, because it started with
        the number 2 and added 2 repeatedly or because it applied the
        successor function repeatedly and double the value before
        printing.
    5.  The pedestrian dialed 911 because he believed it to be the
        emergency number and had recognized the urgent need for
        assistance.

-   Accounts (1), (2), and (3), all the terms refer to properties of
    objects within the closed system.[^1]
-   Accounts (4) and (6) are different in this important respect: Both
    make substantive reference to entities or properties that are not an
    intrinsic part of their state description, that is *numbers* and
    *need for assistance*.

> How is it possible for properties of the world to determine behavior
> when the properties are not causally related in the required sense to
> to the functional states of the system? --- **Brentano's problem**

-   The notion of representation is necessary only in the context of
    explanation.
-   Behavior is being caused by certain states of one's brain, and so
    mental states themselves are related to agent's actions.
-   Brain states are not causally connected in appropriate ways to
    walking or mountains.
    -   The relationship *is one of content*, a semantic, not causal,
        relationship.
        -   The notion of content is roughly that of what the states
            *are about*.

    -   Brain states cause certain movements. If these movements are
        view as members of equivalence classes described as "writing a
        sentence about walking in the Santa Cruz mountains" the brains
        states must be treated as embodying representations of these
        codes by certain rules.

-   Contrast the brain to a watch -- a watch's "behavior" is considered
    coextensive with the set of movements corresponding to the physical
    description of behavior.
    -   Two ways of explaining human behavior capture extremely
        different generalizations.

#### Representational and Functional Levels

-   This shows that **a *functional* description of mental processes is
    not enough, there must also be content**.

> If the content makes a difference to behavior, is it not also a
> functional difference?

-   To be in a certain representational state is to have a certain
    symbolic expression in some part of memory.
    -   The expression *encodes* the semantic interpretation and the
        combinatorial structure of the expression encodes the relation
        among the contents of the subexpressions, much as in the
        combinatorial system of predicate calculus.

-   The reason there must be symbolic codes is that they can enter in
    causal relations.[^2]
-   If there is a unique symbolic expression corresponding to each
    content, one might expect functional states and representational
    states to once again be one-to-one relation. Not so, because:
    1.  There may be codes with the same semantic content which are
        functionally but not semantically distinguishable.
    2.  Merely possessing a certain symbolic expression that encodes
        semantic content is insufficient to produce behavior.
        -   You need to *interpret* the symbols.

Semantic-level generalization
:   Generalizations expressible in terms of the semantic content of
    representations.

:   Newell calls this "knowledge-level."

Symbol-level generalizations
:   Generalizations expressible in terms of functional properties of the
    functional architecture.

#### Representational Content as Defining a Level of Description

-   We abandoned a biological vocabulary because of arbitrarily large
    disjunctions corresponding to processes like "thinking."
    -   Functional generalizations cannot be captured in a finite
        neurophysiological description.
    -   There is a vocabulary in between "*n* fired at *t* with *v*" and
        "He called 911 because he believed he was in an emergency."
        -   And it's *functional*.
        -   And it's in *semantic terms*.

-   "The principal of rationality is a major reason for our belief that
    a purely functional account will fail to capture certain
    generalizations, hence, that a distinct new level is required."

##### Levels and Constraints on Realizability

-   For a description, that description might be compatible with other
    levels.
    -   Newtons laws "are compatible with" biological taxonomy.

### Kirsh, "When is Information Explicitly Represented?"

#### Introduction

-   Computation is the process of making *ex*plicit what was *im*plicit.
-   We know what is explicit, the problem is what information is implicit.
-   **Suppose**: To understand a computation it is necessary to track
    the trajectory of informational state the computing system follows
    as it winds its way to an explicit answer.
-   Different kinds of computational mechanisms:
    -   PDP systems
    -   Massive cellular automata
    -   Analog relaxation systems

-   How far do you have to remove "explicitness" until it's implicit? That
    is, intuitively.
-   Suppose a system has highly ambigious encodings and must deliberate to
    choose the right interpretation.

> Computer and cognitive scientists talk as if they have a precise idea of
> these concepts (of implicit and explicit,) but that do not.

-   **Intent**: Articulate a particular conception of explicit information
    that at least may serve as a stable base for subsequent inquiries into
    the meaning of implicit information.
    1.  Will show why notions of explicit and implicit need elucidation,
        that they are not consistent.
    2.  Will explore efforts to identify explicit information with
        syntatically and semantically well-defined representations.
    3.  Will mention some implications of the view.

#### Our intuitions about explictness are inconsistent

-   Perhaps the intuition is that "if it's there for all to see", then
    it's explicit.
    -   Four tempting properties of explicitness:
        1.  **Locality**: They are visible structures with a definite
            defintion.
        2.  **Movability**: No matter where in a book a word is found or
            where in the library a book is stored, that word retains its
            meaning and retains its explicitness.
        3.  **Meaning**: Words have a definite information content.
        4.  **Availability**: The information content of a word is directly
            available to the system reading it, no elaborotate transition or
            interpretation process is necessary to extract the information it
            represents.

> The trouble with using immediate grapability, or better *immediate
> readability* as the mark of explicitness is that we run into problems
> as soon as we ask whether to count accessing time as part of the reading
> process.

-   Are elements in large sets immediate readable?
    -   This takes *computational energy* but is somehow *constant*/

-   From a process perspective information is explicit only when it is
    *ready to be used*
    -   No computation necessary.

-   Explicitness is tied to usability.


#### Our intuitions about implcitness are inconsistent

-   Our concept of implicit runs into problems when we try to pin down
    what "in principle, recoverable" means.
    -   Is it how much effort is required?
    -   Our all lemmas, "nearby" or "far", equally as implicit?

-   To make it more natural, perhaps the conception of *that which
    is not explicit but which could be made so*.

#### Why it matters whether our intuitions are unsetteled

#### Towards a theory of explicitness

##### Four condition on explicitness

Locality

:   They states, structures, or processes - henceforth symbols -
    which explcitly encode information must be easily seperable
    from each other.

Movability

:   An ambigious language may explicitly encode information only if
    it is trivial to indetify the syntatic and semantic indentity of
    the symbol.

Immediately readable

:   Symbols explicitly encode information if they are either:
    -   Readable in constant time.
    -   Sufficiently small to fall in the attention span of an operator.

Meaning

:   The information which a symbol explictly encodes is given by the set of
    associated states, structures, or processes it activates in constant
    time.

#### Implications

-   One of the following is false:
    -   The LOT is the best level of analysis to represent perspicuously
        the episodes of in our *mental life*.
    -   The events in our mental life are identical with operations on
        explicit representations.
    -   The LOT perspicously describes human information processing.

------------------------------------------

Eliminativism

:   Unless there's a transparent relationship between folk psychology
    and scientific psychology, then the attitude to hold towards folk
    psychology is *elimination*.

-   Ramsey still agrees with Fodor in *eliminativism*.
    -   Stich, in the 80s and 90s, was an eliminativist.
    -   Especially, "The Case Against Belief" didn't think there'd
        be a transparent relationship.
    -   Egan thinks there *both* wrong, that is the eliminativists.
        -   The paper on this is "Folk Psychology and Cognitive Architechure"

### On Pylyshyn

-   He wants to justify and vindicate justification with regards
    to representation.
    -   Why content?
    
-   The argument for a certain way of construing vehicles pervades
    the whole book.
    -   *We cannot eliminate appeal to content*.

-   Stich argued that if we really are symbol systems, like Fodor thinks,
    then why do we need content?
    -   Pylyshyn is trying to justify the appeal to content.

#### The First Puzzle

-   Brain states are not causally connected to ... 
    -   "I believe there's beer in the refrigerator."
    -   There's not causal connection between the object and my
        brain states.
        -   There *needn't* be a causal connection.

    -   I'm thinking about Paris and that might cause me to book
        a vacation to Paris.

-   The solution is how mental states fit into the physical world.

> Why does he think we need content if it is the physical stuff
> that is realized?

-   Pylyshyn uses the capturing language as a way of "getting the
    generalization."
-   The difference between us and watches.
    -   We get convinience from "thermometer gets the tempurature."
    -   We really need do need generalizations to explain our behavior,
        it's only convinient for everything else.

### The Scheme

$$ \lbrace I_1 ... I_n \rbrace $$
$$ f_I $$
$$ \lbrace S_1 ... S_n \rbrace $$
$$ f_R $$
$$ \lbrace P_1 ... P_n \rbrace $$

-   The three levels:
    1.  Interpretations level
    2.  Interpretation function
    3.  Syntatitic level
    4.  Realization function
        -   Maps physical state to symbol (numeral) 2 or 3 ...
        -   Nothing stops it from a bizzare representation.
        -   Indepedant from meaning

    5.  Physical states
        -   These have *many* causal functions.
        -   These can bring about states, but those states
            can *bring about* cognitively important states.

-   Fodor think that we need an LOT, so he wants to identify a level
    where structures that function as words and they have *constituency
    relationships*.

> **Niko**: If you want to be representational about this, you can say that
> the mapping is just useful to us ...

     |   |     |
    P1  P2 -> P3

    An "adding machine" on this model.

### What's the role of content?

-   If the *I*s and the *P*s are in a one-one relationship, then you 
    get not explanatory leverage.
    -   Why can't we just explain the systems behvior in terms of the
        causally efficacious states.

> What is implicit in this is not that there is a one-to-one function,
> but that there are arbitrarily many disjunctions

-   The rationality principle says that these transition states need
    to be *truth-preserving*.
-   There is an *implicit assumption* about explaining cognition that
    we are doing something inherently rational already.

-   Here's something that is paradigm of cognitive but not rational:
    -   If we can succesfully characterize someone in this way, if they
        have the *p* and the *p* to *q*
    -   These models are used to describe data that *is*. "Cognitive function."

-   This kind of explantory projects is going to be applied to sub-cognitive
    functions and phenomena.
    -   Not just the personal level of behavior.
    -   Open up the principle of rationality

-   Fodor in the appendix appeals to theory or processing, these theories
    are commited to mental representations, so this provides support for
    the RTM and by commitment the LOT.
    -   A lot of these examples, the successes do not fit the model the
        content of attitudes, beliefs, desires.

> **Niko**: Is the argument that you want to get rid of the interpretation
> level but that's silly because that's where we began to explain.

-   No, that's Prof. Egan's argument.
    -   The argument *here* is that there's going to be a series of unprincipled
        generalizations without principles of rationality.
    -   These are understood as generalizations.
        -   Unless we can understand these truth-preserving.

> **Ben**: Couldn't you weaken it, the more plausible claim is if we
> lose the generalizations, we lose these great explanations.

-   Derivability isn't a basic notion.
    -   We can reconstruct it to be truth preserving.

Derivability

:   What goes on in the middle level, the higher-level causation.

#### Egan's View

-   Unless what the system is doing is *recognizabily cognitive*,
    this isn't worth doing.
    -   It can add, it can compute, it can speak, it can see, it can
        recover the 3D structure of the scene.
        -   To do this, we need content.

    -   Unless you can attribute content, you *can* talk about causal
        stories, you cannot explain Mary's *behavior*.
        -   The folk psychological explaination makes it rational.

-   This point will come up in Ramsey's IO representations.
    -   Unless we can construe the inputs and outputs of the system,
        as cognitive function, then the project *doesn't make any sense.*
    -   We're trying to explain a cognitive competence. We at least need
        to interpret the inputs and outputs of the system as contentful.

#### On the third argument, pg. 27

-   My brain states are not causally connected to Paris, or walking, or mountains.
-   The relationship must be in terms in content.

### On Kirsch

-   The main point is that intuitions about explicitness and implicitness
    are very broken, but that does not stop philosophers and others from using
    these notions fairly heavily.
    -   Our concept on explicit representation rests pretty heavily on the printed
        word.
    -   Construing explicit representation on the printed word, litterally sentences
        in the head, assumes that explicit representation can be understood in
        purely *functional* terms.
        -   The big point he wants to get across is that this has to come across
            in *procedural* terms.

-   It's often assumed that we know what *explicit* is, but not what *implicit* is,
    and so implicit is defined in terms of not-explicit.
-   He distinguishes between *exploiting* regularities in the environment and
    *representing* regularities in the environment.

### On Marr

> So why are we reading Marr? A lot of the work he's done has been falsified.

-   Not interested in the details, interested in the methodology

#### Marr's Methodology

-   He thought that an account of a cognitive system has three different levels.
    -   Those are:
        1.  **Theory of computation**: Specification of the function computed.
            That is, the *what* that the system is doing. This is the level at
            which the competence of the system is, knowledge, processing details.
        2.  **Representation & Algorithm**: This level specific the alogirthm which
            computes the function speficied in the theory of computation (level 1).
            And it specifies structures over which the alogirthm which it is defined.
            *Ex*. A function can be added, the algorithm can be Roman or Arabic.
        3.  **Neural interpretation**: This is, in some sense, the *how*.

-   The big picture:
    1.  Gray level array
    2.  Primal sketch
    3.  Has multiple:
        -   SFM
        -   Stereoscopic
        -   Texture
        -   Shading

    4.  $2 \frac{1}{2}$D
    5.  3D

-   **Next time**: SFM

### Ramsey, *Representation Reconsidered*

#### Section 1.2 <small>The job description challenge</small>

-   Operating on the **assumption**: By reflecting a bit on ordinary notions of
    representation, we could gain a better understanding of what it is that
    scientists are referring to when they claim the brain uses such states.
    -   **Worry**: Why need to look at commonsense notions of representation at
        all. 
        -   A theoretical notion is introduced in scientific theories in such a
            manner that give the posit its specific explantory role.
        -   For example, position genens involes a specification of the diferent
            relations and causal roles that *we think* genes perform.
        -   With this is mind, we go a look for the physical thing to fit the
            bill.

-   For representation, things are not so simple.
    -   We already have a notion of representation that is "home" in non-scientifc
        contexts, and this contrains what representation can qualify
        as representational.
    -   **Want**: These notions of representation to provide a specification of the
        essential features of representation.
    -   **Want**: A *job description* for representation like genes or protons have.

-   **Problem**: Our commonsense notions do not do this.
    -   These notions have core features and offer job descriptions 
        representational states.
    -   **Problem *clearer***: Stems from sort of features and roles that are 
        associated with these notions.
        -   The relevant roles include things like:
            1.  Informing
            2.  Denoting
            3.  Standing for something else

        -   How are these suppose to be cashed out naturalistically.

        > Many scientific theories of the mind attempt to explain cognition in
        > neurological or computaional terms. But our ordinary undersntadning of
        > representation involves features and roles that can't be translated into
        > such terms in any obvious way.

-   Consider our ordinary notions of mental representation.
    -   **Claim**: Common sense understnading of beliefs, desires, and other
        folk-representational states assigns them some sort of "underived or
        intrinsic intentionalality."
        -   Intentionality clearly isn't basic, functionally or causally.
        -   So when we look at a system for these states, we don't really know
            what we're looking for.

-   A similar **problem** arises with regard to the commonsense understanding
    of non-mental representation.
    -   Every day examples of non-mental represenatations, like:
        -   Road signs
        -   Pieces of written text,
        -   Warning signs, so on

    -   These all invole an *agents* who use the representations to stand
        for something else.
    -   The folk notions of representations, therefore, will not suffice
        if transplanted directly into cognitive science.

Job description challenge

:   There needs to be some unique role or set of causal relations that warrants our
    saying some structure or states serves a representational function.

> What might a successful job description for cognitive representation look like?

-   **Depends on**: What notion of representation we use.
    -   Reductive theories cannot use representation as an explantory
        primitive.
    -   If we understand processes as representational, then we need an
        account of representation in computational, mechanical, or causal
        physical terms.
    -   **Conclusion**: Positing inner representations needs to include some
        sort of story about how the structure or state in question actually
        plays a representational role.

-   **Analogy**: Someone offers an account of some organic process,
    and the account needs a structure called a pump.
    -   The advocate of this account would need to offer an explnanation
        of how this thing actually serves as a pump, as opposed to say
        a sponge.
    -   And this explnanation will be a *functional* one.

-   **Conclusion**: Cognitive researchers who invoke a notion of inner
    representation in their reductive accounts must provide some
    explanation of how the thing they positi serves as a representation.
    -   This is the **problem of pan-representationalism**.
    -   **Goal**: Argue that this hypothetical situation is in fact the 
        actual sitation in a wide range of newer cognitive theories.

-   The meeting of the job description is not the same as providing a naturalistic
    account of content.
    -   This would present the set of physical or causal conditions that ground
        the content of the representation.
    -   Different version of naturalistic content:
        -   Nomic dependency relations
        -   Causal links to the world
        -   Evolutionary function
        -   Conceptual roles within a given system

    -   These explain a certain *relation*, but not that relations *function*
        as a representation in a physical system.

-   **Analogy**: A compass.
    -   One type of question: How the compass actually functions as a 
        representational device, how it informs a cognitive agent.
    -   Another type of question: What conditions are responsible for
        the representational content of the compass.

-   Why this is pressing:

    > "Look, I'm not completely sure how state X comes to the content it has,
    > but in my explanation of cogintive, there needs to be a state X that
    > serves as a representation in the following way."

-   The *crux* of the job description challenge
    -   If conditions on representation are too strong, something "left explained"
    -   If condition on represestation are too week, it's ambiguous and ubiquitous.

-   Millikan attempts to provide something that applies to mental and non-mental
    representation.
    -   To function as a representation is to be "consumed" by an interpreter
        that treats the state in question as indicating some condition.
        -   Fine for non-mental.
        -   Unclear for mental, consumption *inside* a system.

    -   This account is "under-reduced."

-   Dretske, as it will be shown, over-redcuded.
    -   Intutively, his conditions have nothing to do with representation at all.

-   It may seem impossible to meet the job description challenge, but no,
    certain theories in the CCTC paradigm have done it.
    -   **Claim**:the difference between the two corresponds to the division
        classical theories of computation and non-classical accounts of cognition.

Job description challenge, *improved*

:   There are two parts:

    1.  Is it possible to describe physical or computational processes in
        representational terms?
    2.  Is it absolutely necessary to describe physical or computational 
        processes in representational terms?

> Even a rock can be described as acting on the belief that it needs to sit 
> very still.

-   The reason this fails is because the notion of representation is too weak.
-   In the "other way",  we can described biological systems *in terms of* molecules
    and toms, it is nevery *necessary* to invoke representational langauge in theory
    characterization of a representational syste,

Job Description Challenge, *improved ... again *

:   Three questions:

    1.  Is there some explanotory benefit in described an internal elements
        of a physical or computational process in representational terms?
    2.  Is there an element of a proposed process or architecture that is
        functioning as a representation in a sufficienitly robust or
        recognizable manner, and if so, how does it doe this?
    3.  Given that theory X invokes internal representations in its account
        of process Y, are the internal states playing this sort of role,
        and if so, how?

-   Unfortunately, "explanatory benefit" and "sufficiently robust" are
    not as robust as we would like.
    -   Requires a "judgement call."

#### Section 3.1 <small>IO-representation</small>

-   **Previously**: Marr's model of cognitive science involved three level of
    -   The top level involved the specification of a function that defines the sort of
        cognitive capacity we want explained.
    
        > Consider again a simple operation like multiplication. Although we say various
        > mechanical devices do multiplication, the transformation of numbers into 
        > products is something that, strictly speaking, no physical system could ever
        > do. Numbers and products are abstract entities, and physical systems can't
        > perform operations on abstract entities. So at the algorithmic level we
        > positi symbolic representations of numbers as inputs to the system and
        > symbolic representations of products as outputs. We re-define the task of
        > multiplication as the task of transforming numerals of one sort into numerals
        > of another sort.

    -   The input to a cognitive system: say, "faces".
        -   The output of a cognitive system: say, "That's so-and-so."

-   How do IO-representation concerns meet the job description challenge? **Two
    responses**:
    1.  **Avoid** the question altogether. "Outside the domain of 
        cogntive theorizing."[^10]
        -   We're actual in the business *of explaing the porcesses and operations
            that convert input representations into output representations*[^9]

    2.  **Say**: Minds do certain things, and one of the main things they do is
        "perform cogitive tasks properly described as types of representations."
        -   It is a *fact of nature*.

Interior IO representations

:   Interior input–output representations are a sub-system’s own 
    inputs and outputs that are internal to the larger super-system’s 
    explanatory framework.

#### Section 3.2 <small>S-representation</small>

#### Section 3.3 <small>Two objects and their replies</small>

##### Challenge 2: IO-representation and S-representation aren't sufficiently real

-   Made appeals to the *explantory benefit* and *explanatory pay-off* of
    IO and S notions of representation.
    -   And that *there is a* payoff.
    -   Is it a *useful fiction*? Do it real?

-   Dennet on the topics:
    -   Physical stance

        :   Use an understanding of the physical inner workins of the system to explain
            and predict how it responds to different inputs.

    -   Design stance

        :   Predict behavior by using what we know about the osrt of tasks that the
            system was *designed* to perform.

    -   Intetional stance

        :   The intentional stance involves treating a system as a rational agent with
            beliefs, desires, and other folk-representationl states.

    True believer

    :   Little more than being a system whose behavior can be succesfully explained and
        predicted through the ascription of beliefs and other propositional attitudes.

-   **Challenge**: If the CCTC is a theory that invokes *real* representations, 
    then it needs objectively realy representations.
-   **Response**: They *are* real, and here's why.
    -   There's a sense in which most things are *observer-dependant*.
        -   It's always possible to view a system as a series of interacting atoms.
        -   **If** IO and S representations are unreal only in the sens which trees,
            minerals, hearts, mountains, and species are unreal, **then** a reality
            about representation should be able to live with *that* sort of
            "anti-realism."

### Review of RR <small>by Mark Sprevak</small>

-   **Structure of Ramsey's *negative* argument**:
    1.  Argue that in order for something to be an *X*, it must satisfy a description *D*.
        -   This is the *job description* or *minimal conditions for representation*.

    2.  Argue that to the best of our knowledge, nothing satisfies *D*.
        -   "How do our best psychological theories use the notion of representation?"

    3.  Conclude that since nothing satifies *D*, there are no *X*s.
        -   Ramsey finds all theories unsatisfactory, there are no representations.

-   On step 1:
    -   For a state to be a representation:
        1.  Non-derived intentionality
        
            :   Be capable of having original intentional content.

        2.  Causality
        
            :   Interact causally with other cognitive states.

        3.  Connection
        
            :   (1) and (2) must be linked: The causal role that representation plus 
                should be *determined by* it's intentional content.

-   On step 2:
    -   The **exception**: CCTV
        -   CCTV is commited to representation in 2 ways:
            1.  IO-representation
            2.  S-representations

    -   On IO-representation:
        -   Representations are needed as the gross-inputs and outputs of cognitive
            agents.
        -   But also the steps of a computation need representations, so internal
            representations.

    -   On S-representation
        -   CCTC is commited to positive interinal representations. (I'm not sure why
            this or if this is bad?)

### Structure for motion

-   The visual system is able to recover the 3D dimension of a scene
    with on 2D input.
    -   Some of the sources of information:
        -   **Stereoptics**: The visual system uses disparity to get a vantage
            point on a scene.
        -   **Motion**: Relative motion, what the visual system gets is a series
            of images that are different in certain respects. A series of retinal
            images.
    
    -   One thing that Ullman and Hildreth point out is that there are an infinite
        number of 3D representations out of any 2D input.
        -   The visual system is aided by physical constraints and assumptions.

-   The relevant assumption for this mechanism: *rigitidy*.

Rigidity

:   Objects in the environment when they're moving is that they are solids.

    > "[T]hey assume that if it is possible to interpret the changing 2-D images as
    > the projection of a rigid 3-D object in motion, then such an interpretation
    > should be chosen."

SFM Theorem

:   Three distinct views of 4 non-coplanar points is sufficient to determine
    a rigid configuration for the points.

-   If you see the object long enough and in good enough conditions, then
    when the SFM theorem is saying is that there is *only one* rigid configuration
    of points.
    -   There's a lot more non-rigid configuration, but *assuming rigidity*, it
        is much easier to compute a representation. That is, there are less 
        configurations.

> **Niko**: Why think that *points* are primitive, why not plains?[^6]

-   An organism that SFM with minimum input will react to the world better than
    an organism that does not have SFM, rigidity, etc. More plausible for this reason?
-   If an object is getting bigger with regards to a visual field, what are the
    possible interpretations?
    -   It's getting *bigger*.
    -   It's getting *closer*.
    -   A mix of the two.

-   This type of adaptation is only going to useful in an environment where most
    objects are rigid in translation[^5].
-   The environmental assumptions are motivated by adaptation.
    1.  Powerful, rigidity forces a unique solution
    2.  True, doesn't make the organism "screw up"
    3.  Unspecific, true in most cases, general claim about the environment, will
        support a lot of counterfactuals.

> What is the status of the rigidity assumption? Is it innate?

-   *Exploits* regularities but doesn't *represent* regularities.
    -   We can *count* it as *innate knowledge* *if we want*, but it isn't
        explicitly represented and almost certainly not *explicitly* represented.

-   The environment can be exploited without be represented.
    -   First step for the theorist is to look at the environment.
        -   Spiky?
        -   Squishy?
        -   Solid?

-   Steps:
    1.  Commonsense characterization of the problem, explandadum.
    2.  Put on lab coat and look at exactly what the competence is.
        -   Is this a competence for determining 3-D structure *simpliciter*?
        -   No, 3-D *rigid* structure.
        -   "Looking for assumptions."

    3.  Look for algorithms that explain the phenomena

### Ramsey

#### Chapter 1

> What is it for a state in the head to be a representation?

-   Couple of things to distinguish:
    -   As a question "what it is for a thing in the head to have meaning or
        conent? What is it to have content? What determines contents of internal
        representations?" *Problem of intentionality side*
        -   The answer for *external* representations is convention, we agree on 
            meanings for items in the language. 
        -   This cannot be the answer for *internal* representation.
        -   Cannot specificy little "agents in the head." Because regress? No agents.
        -   There's going to be a naturalistic account of how internal structures
            and states, naturalistic hope, relation between states and structures in
            the head and the objects in the world.
        -   To say that it's naturalistic is to discount, say, semantic relations.

    -   Personal and sub-personal processes.
        -   Like a map, people use maps, we use them to navigate, etc.
        -   This kind of answer isn't going to work for mental interpretations.
        -   When theories posit these states or structures, it's only appropriate
            to think of these, they're not used by *people*, it's a category mistake
            to think of Prof. Egan as *using* the primal sketch to navigate the world,
            it's her *system* that uses the primal sketch.

> **Ben**: I don't see any *job* for it to do. What he said led me to believe that it
> not a necessary condition on representation that is has semantic content.

-   This is a *possibility*
    -   A theory might posit a symbol structure

> What Ramsey is thinking about is being a representation and not about what it is to
> have content.

-   Remember the distinction between *personal* and *sub-personal* representation.
    -   **Question**: What is it for a physical thing to represent another?
        -   It should be used in a characteristcally representational way. *Useless*.
        -   Content is in som way relevant to how it functions, or it's effects. So
            the representation is causally efficacious, causes effects in cognition,
            and the content is relevant to those effect *in some way*, I say in
            *in some way* because it isn't at all clear how 

> **Egan**: Content is a way of summarizes what is *causally relevant* or the *causal*
> role of a belief[^7].

-   Dretske, on the other hand, thinks that content has to get its hands on the wheel.
    -   This can't be right, content is not driving the car.

-   It cannot be a consequence of doing that job that too many thing count as
    as representational.
-   The theorizing we're doing do no presuppose propositional attitudes or 
    representational capacities.
    -   A theory that is doing this may *under-explain*.

-   If you describe cognition in terms of atoms, quarks, molecules, ...
    -   This is *over-explaining*.
    -   It's damning to say, "Hey, where is the intentionality?"
        -   We have to be careful to not fall into this trap.

-   Avoid positing un-explained intelligence, but posit intelligence.
    -   How can intelligence arise, or emerge, from non-intelligent.

-   It would illegimate to complain about they're being nothing conscious in an
    explanation of consciousness.
    -   You look at an organism in it's environment and that *is* to interpret
        what it's doing cognitively.
        -   It's computing some cognitive function.

    -   **Egan**: Using this is a really robust way, which systems are appropriate
        to explain psychological.

> **Niko**: Maybe it's true that we have evidence that something is cognitive
> if we attribute to a system doing a computation on representations. Is it intentional?

-   At the moment, all (Egan) is doing is trying to put our cognitive attributions
    in context.
    -   *When do we attribute cognition?*

#### Chapter 3

-   To call mething cognitive is to call something an IO system
-   We go around attributing cognitive capacities to people, and for the animals, we
    do it on the basis of behavior.
    -   What we *attribute* is a *competence* and this goes *beyond the behavior*.
    -   *How would the system behave if it was given different inputs?*
    -   For Marr, the competence is at the top-level of the theory.

-   Right now, this defintion of cognition is related to Haugeland's IBB.
    -   Only when we have behvaioral event that something is doing something
        cognitive.

-   How do you say something plays chess?
    -   You treat it as a representing thing as representing chess moves, or something.
    -   You have to treat the sub components, the subprocesses, these have to be
        operating on chess moves as well.

> **Ben**: A requirement on a sub-representation is the same ... as a super-
> representation (or something). So is it syntatic and representational *all-the
> way down*? 

-   In some of these decompostional reductions, whenever you're doing this,
    whether it be the big or small process, whenever you're invoking representations,
    you need to invoke contents. 
    -   He's *not* saying that you always have to do it in this way.
    -   Each, eventualy, these IBS IBB will "bottom out"

-   As long as you're invoking representations, you have to go "whole hog" on it.
-   *Can't we treat them as uninterpreted symbols?*

> We could, of course, employ a syntactic type of task-decompositional 
> explanation. We could track the causal roles of the syntactically 
> individuated symbols, and thereby divide the internal processes into 
> syntactic sub-processes. But we wouldn’t be able to make sense of 
> these operations as computationally pertinent stages of the larger 
> task being explained. **Ramsey, pg. 76**

-   He's *putting off* the big question: Is it *really* an adder?
    -   He falls back on the wholism response.
    -   We're attributing the intentinos and representaitons together.

-   Are intuitions important for cognitive theorizing?[^8]
    -   In calling it *seeing*, we're pretty much committed to representation.

-   There's certain structural similarities between entities on a map of NJ
    and NJ itsel
    
-   There's stccertain structural similarities between entities on a map of NJ
    and New JJ itself.

-   It's not an isomorphism, it's a morphism.
    -   What breaks the symmetry?

-   Next time: Chapter 4, and the two objections

### Questions

1.  Levels of description

    Level of description | Has representation?
    ---------------------|--------------------
    ... | No (presumably)
    Atoms | No
    ... | No
    Biology | No (Maybe)
    Neuroscience | ???
    ... | 
    Cognition | ???
    Folk psychology | Yes
    Utterances | Yes

    At first, there's the physical states. It then moves to the biological
    states. And then the cognitive states.

    Is this a good roadmap of the ontology? Of where we're trying to describe
    and ascribe representation? If not, what's better?

2.  The debate

    -   Ramsey: *elimitavist about the mind on grounds of the best cognitive models
        not having it*
        1.  CCTV have representations, and their good ones (answer job description)
        2.  Neither CCTV is true nor are representations possible?
        3.  Representation and content - isomorphism - capable of content

    -   Fodor: 
        1.  Realist about FP
        2.  FP $\to$ LOT $\to$ RTM
        3.  RTM and LOT have representations.
        4.  ???

3.  Circularity and striking parellelism

February 25th, 2013 <small>Reading</small>
------------------------------------------

### Dretske, "Misrepresentation" (background)

-   *How do we manage to get things wrong?*
    -   *How is it possible for a physical system to **misrepresent** the state of
        their surroundings?*

-   **Assumption**: Belief is a *non-derived* representational capacity the exercise
    of which *can* yield a representation.
-   The capacity to misrepresent is only a part of the general problem of meaning
    and intentionality.
    -   Once you have meaning, "lavish" it on to your descriptions.
    -   Once you have intentionality, you can "adopt the intentional stance."

#### Natural Signs

-   Naturally occuring signs mean something, without assistance from us.
    
    > Water does not flow uphill; hence, a northerly flowing rivers means there is
    > a downward gradient in that direction.

    -   The power of these events or conditions to mean what they do is independant
        of the way we interpret them.
        -   Or whether we interpret them at all.

    -   There was meaning before intlligent organisms, capable of exploiting
        meaning.
    -   If we are looking for meaning, misrpresentation is a promising place to 
        begin.

-   Natural signs are *indicators*, more or less *reliable*, and *what they mean* is
    what *they indicate to be so*.
    -   The power of a natural sign to mean something emerges from objective constraints,
        lawful relations, between the sign and the condition that constitutes its
        meaning.
    -   It's usually *causal* or *lawful*.
    -   It's *counterfactual supporting*.

### Ramsey, *Representation Reconsidered*, ch. 4

#### Introduction

-   Will **argue**: The notions of representation explored in the net two chapters
    do *not* mean the *job description challenge*.
    -   In fact, it also leads to *deep misconceptions*.
    -   The *receptor notions* of representation.
        -   Alternatively, *detector*.

    -   Not a theoretically useful notion.
    -   Will **deny**: Structures that do recepting are serving as representations.

-   **Structure**
    1.  Spell out the basic idea of receptor representation.
    2.  Will **ask** how well this notion fares with regard to the job description
        challenge.
    3.  Will **show**: Dretske's own account of representation overlaps a great deal
        with the receptor notion, yet is more sophiticated and robust.
    4.  Will **argue**: Neither representation nor misrepresneetation is without
        serioues flaw.
    5.  The receptor notion should be abandoned.

#### The receptor notion

Receptor notion

:   Because a given neural or computational structure is regularly and reliably
    activated by some distal condition, it should be regarded as having the role
    of representation (indicating, signaling) that condition. 

    Such structures are viewed as representations *because* of the way they are
    triggered to go into particular states by other conditions.

:   *Example*: Certain neurons should be viewed as "detectors" *precisely because*
    they reliably respond to certain stimuli.

    Just a though a frog has "convexity detectors" in their brain.

:   > [I]f a cell is claimed to represent a face, then it is necessary to show 
    > that it fires at a certain rate nearly every time a face is present and 
    > only very rarely reaches that rate at other times.

-   The receptor notion of representation is found in connectionist models in
    the similarity of "internal units" to "neural receptors"
    -   It's suggested they provide a more representational role than computational
        symbols.

-   Three examples of the receptor notion in simple organisms:
    1.  Certain neurons in a bugs brain.
    2.  "Face cells" in monkeys
    3.  Magnetosomes "compass-like" represenetation which tell where to go.

-   Whatever the state is that the so called receptor brings about, it is
    "viewed as having the role of representing the external condition because
    of this causual or nomic dependency relation."
-   Philosophers have developed a notion "natural meaning" or "information content"
    that supposedly results from the way a state reliably co-varies with some other
    state of affairs.
    -   This makes people say "*this* smoke *means* *that* fire."

#### The receptor notion and the job description challenge

-   The reception notion faces a *prima facie* difficulty:
    -   **Problem**: The reception notion does not provide an account that reveals
        *why* a given state or structure should be seen as serving as a representation.
        -   **Counterexample**: There are several *non-representational* internal
            states that must in their proper functioning reliably covary with
            various states of affairs. For instnace, *our immunse system consistently
            reacts to infectious insults to our body*. 

    -   **Fix**: While nomic dependency may be an important *element* of representation,
        it is not *sufficient* to be representation.

-   This **problem** leads to a **dilemma**:
    -   If to serve as a representation *just is* to serve as a state that reliably
        responds, then you get overly reduced accounts of representation that lead
        to *pan-representationalism* because of the immune-system objection.
    -   Or, if to serve as representation includes factors that go substantially
        beyond the mere fact that they reliably respond to specific stimuli, then
        we have no clear sense of how states reliably responding to certain stimuli
        are supposed to function as representations.

-   This is closely related to the problem of *pansemanticism*, that is that "meaning
    is just about *everywhere*" and "is a natural conclusion to draw from informational
    analyses of content."

#### Dretske to the rescue?

-   Dretske offers an ambitious account of mental represnetation that is designed
    to be naturalistic about content, and show how content can produce behavior.
    -   What's wrong with Dretske's account will be illuminating with regaurds to a
        fundamental problem for the receptor notion of representation *in general*.


-   Central to the account is the notion of **indication**, a relation based on
    law-like dependency.

Indication
:   > For condition *C* to indicate another condition *F*, *C* must stand in relation
    > to *F* characterized by subjunctives like the following: If *F* had not
    > occured, *C* would not have occured.

-   **Already saw**: that mere nomic dependency is insufficient to bestow full-blown
    representational status on cognitive structures.
    -   This is the **disjunction problem**, that concerns the difficulty in
        account for misrepresentation when a state's content is based upon the way
        it is triggered by distal conditions.
    -   The **response** to this: "the core of any thoery of representation must
        contains an explanation of how misrepresentation can occur."

-   The **response** is to offer teleological components, placing tighter restrictions
    on the sort of causal relations that matter.

> **Dretske**: Internal indicators are mental representations when they are recruited
> as a cause of certain motor output *because of* their relevant nomic dependancies.

-   This does two things for Dretske:
    1.  Enables him to handle the problem of misrepresentation
        -   Error is no possible because we can say that whenever an indicator is
            triggered by something other than what it was *supposed to* indicate.

    2.  Gives him a way of showing how informational content can be explanatorily
        relevant.
        -   Structures are recruited as causes to motor output *because* they indicate
            certain conditions.
        -   Being an indicator is a causally relevant feature of a strcture, so 
            being a type of *meaning* is causally relevant.

> **Dretske**: To serve as a representation is necessarilly to:
>
> 1.  Stand in some sort of nomic dependancy relation to some distal state of affairs
> 2.  Becoming incorporated into the processing *because* of this dependancy, thereby
>     acquiring the function of indicating those states of affairs.

##### Does Dretske's account of representation function help?

-   **Dretske is committed to**: *If* neural structures are actually recruited as
    causes of bug-catching movements because they are reliably caused to fire
    by the presence of bugs, *then* it certainly seems tempting to assume that
    they are serves as "bug representations."
    -   **Question**: Does this arragment suffice for representation?

-   To answer, distinguish between:
    1.  The puraly causal/physical or nomic dependencies that are thought to "underlie"
        the indication relation
    2.  The quasi-semantic, information relation often said to be "carried by" these
        dependancies.

> If *A* carries information about *B*, (1) is this supposed to be distinct from
> *A*'s being nomically dependant on *B*? (2) Or are those claims indentical?

-   On (1), the infromation carried by *A* is somehow seperate and distinc from
    properities of *A*. It *A* carries information about *B*, it does so whether or
    not anyone exploits it.
    -   This is **ambigous**, refering to either:
        -   The non-semantic nomic depancy
        -   Something more semantically charged, like information 

    -   This is the *realist interpretation of information and indication*.

-   On (2), it's unambigous. This is the *deflationary interpretation of information
    and indication*.

-   The **central problem**: Dretske's account of representation appears to assume
    that if a given structures is incorporated into a system's processing because
    it nomically depends on a certain state of affairs, it automatically follows that
    it being used to stand for that state of affairs.
    -   This **unsupported** and **almost certainly false**.

> causal gap between the pulling of the trigger and the discharge of the round.

> well. When this happens, one of the objects is serving as a type of 
> representational device.

-   **Conclusion**
    -   If we equate *being an indicator* to *being a nomic dependant*, then Dretske
        cannot establish that a strcture is a representation by showing that it
        functions as an indicator because, *trivially*, functioning as an indicator
        just means functioning as a nomic dependant
        -   **And**: There are all sorts of ways to function as a nomic dependant
            without being a representation.

#### Further dimensions of the receptor notion

> **Question**: How do we demarcate between:
> 
> 1.  Cases where the nomic regularity is relevant to a non-representational function
> 2.  Cases wehere it makes sense to say that nomic dependency helps serve as a
>     representation.

-   **Contast**:
    1.  The firing pin in a gun
        -   There is no sense in which the information carried by the firing pin is
            exploited in its normal functioning.

    2.  The mercury in a thermometer
        -   There is a *clear* sense in which it serves to inform people who want to
            learn about the temperature.

#### Does it really matter?

-   People often compain that Ramsey is just being stingy with the word 
    "representation."
    -   Why not treat receptor states as some low-level type of representation?

-   Taken as a point about langauge and our ability to call things what we want, it's
    correct, but silly.

> **Question**: If we *are* so inclined, and nothing is really at stake, then why
> not go ahead and do so?

-   **Answer**: There's a fair bit at stake.
    -   "Representation" and "information" is increasingly just being use to mean
        "reactive neuron" or "causal activity."

-   Here he paints a picture about a real-world case where misconceptions about
    representation derailed progressed and blurred understanding in a study by
    Freeman and Skarda.

#### Summary

-   **Argued**: One of the most popular ways of thinking about representation in
    cognitive science is confused and should be discontinued.
    -   Receptor notions of representation have jobs that have little to do
        with representation.

-   In an effort to supplment the failure, Ramsey brought in Dretske.
    -   Dretske focused on on an indication *functioning* as a representation.
    -   He suggest that receptor type states qualify as representation by virtue
        of the way in which they are incorporated into cognitive architecture.
        -   **But** the functional role is a reliable causal mediator, and not
            a representation.

-   If the receptor notions of representation are in fact the right account of
    representation in connectionism, then RTM is simply false.

### Commentary

I want to be a realist about the external world and I have this premonition 
without proof that my inner representation of the external world reliably covaries
with at least those states important for my continued success. If the way I 
characterize this inner representation is with "indication" and Ramsey's argument
that indication isn't represnetation, then I reject indication as being able to
tell the whole story about representations in the head.

A way that I think indication could be vindicated is by making it a part of 
inner representation instead of claiming that it's all there is. For instance,
perhaps my vision is an indication of what's directly in front of my eyes, my
ears indicate what sounds are in my immediate surroundings, etc, and these indications
are amalgamated by my mind in higher-order mental processing, and it is from this
and these indications that an internal representation emerges.

------------------------------------------

### S-Representation

-   Two key ideas:
    1.  **Structural similarity** between the vehicles of representation and the things
        that they're about, the represented domain.
    2.  The **use** of the representation.
        -   Why is this important? 
        -   If we don't bring in use, what problem are we left with?
        -   The *state* represents *the map*, the map is used in certain ways
            to represent the state.
        -   What *kind* of use? *Surrogative reasoning*, it's use to *say things
            about*, *make claims about* the *domain*. Doormat not relevant cognitive
            use.
        -   **But**, you *could* use the landscape of New Jersey to reason about
            the map. **But** it does break the symettry because you're using the
            one about the other. *Minor bullet-biting*.

-   The **map example**, paradigm of this representation
    -   A map of New Jersey represents some properties and relations, dots represent
        cities, some features of the dots represent relative size.
        -   There are other features of the map that don't have any function
            at all, like perhaps colors.
        -   Colors might make it more salient to see the county divisions, etc.
        -   It's not representing any "shared feature" of these counties.
        -   Not *every* feature maps to a representation, morphism and isomorphism.

    -   Isomorphic
        -   1 to 1
        -   Bijection

    -   Representatino on this model is *holistic*.

[./img/family-tree.png]()

-   When Bob is using this, he has to use the connections correctly for surrogatively
    reasoning.
    -   The map is the clear case, but the other examples include more and more levels
        of abstraction. The *interpretation* of the *representation* needs more levels
        of *abstract*.

[./img/broken-tree.png]()

> How is this going to work for *mental* representation?
> What would *justify* using "AAAAAA" to mean "John"?

-   **Use**.

#### Shank and Abelson

-   Given very general information, and a story.
    -   Like how to take a bus to the city, how to get food in a restaurant.
    -   Lots of information about the situation.
    -   Then, a story about John and Mary, and the program is asked about the
        specific story given the general facts.

    > John and Mary when to some resaturant and they both ordered them medium-rare
    > and got burnt burgers and so they stood up and walked out. **To the machine**:
    > *Did they leave a tip?*

> If the symbols in the Chinese Room constitute scripts of this sort, then they 
> serve as representations, not because there is some conscious interpreter 
> who understands them as such, or because the people who designed the system 
> intended them that way, but because the overall system succeeds by exploiting 
> the organizational symmetry that exists between its internal states and some 
> chunk of the real world.

-   "All Ramsey needs" is *some* morphism that is exploited[^11].
    -   This isomorophism idea isn't *as general* as Ramsey would like to claim.

### Two Objections and Their Replies 

#### Challenge 1: indeterminacy in S-representation (and IO-representation) content 

-   Pragmatic considerations will come out to privelege on interpretation over the
    other.
    -   Ramsey's constraints are *doing a lot of work*,
        1.  that is the explantory agenda and 
        2.  how the system is embedded in the environment.

    -   Having two or three candidates left is *pretty good*.

-   It's often said that "task description" are indeterminate.
    -   The first thing you have to do is consider how the system is working it
        it's environment.
    -   Then working out *what it succesful* at.
        -   "All it has to do is get the unique *rigid* interpretation of the
            sense data."

-   It's not clear how this account will get misrepresentation.
-   There's a distinction between theorists *attributing incorrectly* and
    agents *mispresenting radically*.
    -   Egan is a theorist of vision, she knows we're pretty good at getting
        a 3-D representation of a scene, and except for the dark, we're very
        good at succeeding at this task.
        -   This is compatible with making *some* mistakes, it's not easily
            compatible with making *systematic* mistakes.
        -   But this is going to be a problem regardless of whether you
            assume success or not (disputed).
        -   People *are* representing things when they make systematic
            errors, but how would this explantory account explain this possible
            phenomena?
    
    -   *The project* is to take a phenomena, human conciousness, and explain it.
        If there is systematic failure, then there is nothing to explain (???).
        It's not performing a task (???). It's not *succeeding* at a task.
        -   Success *is a motivation* for looking for representation.
        -   **Endgoal**: Psychological capacties explanation.

#### Challenge 2: IO-representation and S-representation aren’t sufficiently real

-   "You're *just imposing* your way of understanding on the machine or person,
    it isn't that *it's there*, you're *assigning* it to physics.[^12]"
    -   Grouping together physical states is interest-relative, but it is objective
        that *the states are there*.

-   Identifying real properties of the device, just a real as genes, but if we
    don't care about diseases then we don't care about biochemical engineering
    (or similar statements about other fields).
    -   So atoms *are just not relevant* to what we're trying to explain.
    -   Unless you're also instrumentalist about gene descriptions and
        genetics, then you should be a realist about representation in the
        way it's been built.

### Presentation <small>by Ben</small>

#### Background: Ramsey's Question

-   The original question: "Is this thing reallyu functioning in a way that is 
    reconizably representation in nature?"
    -   Ramsey asks if various theoretical posits called "representations" accords with
        out *pre-theoretical* concept of a representation.
    -   The **worry**: Science might start out with commonsense notions (mass, energy,
        representation), but science quickly leaves common sense behind.
        -   Compare Ramsey's question to the following: "Is the physicist's energy really
            functioning in a recognizably energy-like in nature?"
        -   "Matter, motion, energy, work, liquid, and other common sense notions ... are
            abandoned as naturalistic inquiry proceeds; a physicist asking whether a pile
            of sand is a solid, liquid, or gas ... spends no time asking how the terms
            are used in ordinary discourse, and would not expect the answer to the latter
            question to have anything to do with natural kinds, if these are kinds in
            nature" (Noam Chomsky, *New Horizons in the Study of Language and Mind*, pg.
            21).
        -   So if our goal is to understand the mind, why worry about Ramsey's question?

    -   A slightly modified question: How do mental representation compare to paradigm
        representations such as sentences and maps.
        -   Answer this question might help us to better understand the nature of the
            mental representation posited by our theories.
        -   Ramsey can be read as answering this question.

#### Ramsey on Dretske's receptor representations

-   Ramsey argues that neither Dretske's account of *misrepresentation* nor his account
    of representational *function* gives us reason to believe that receptor 
    "representations" are representations in any interesting sense.
-   Misrepresentation
    -   The **problem**: When a cell in the frog's eye respond to a flying BB, why
        is it misrepresenting that there is fly rather than accuratly representing
        that there is *either* a fly *or* a BB?
    -   Dretske's **answer**: The *function* of the cell is to activate in the presence
        of flies. So the cell (mis)represents that there is a fly.
    -   Ramsey's **response**: Dretske's answer only work if we already know that the cell
        in question representation *something or other* and we're just trying to
        figure out *what* it represents.

-   Representational function
    -   Roughly, according to Dretske a representation is a structure

February 27th, 2014 <small>Office hourse</small>
------------------------------------------------

1.  Why is it that with regards to content, that it is implicit that if you can get
    some sort of notational "picking out" of the unique object in the world you
    get "objective/naturalistic/determinant" content? Specifically, with regards
    to representation, why is it important that we "pick out" the unique interpretation
    of a representation? I'm reminded of Frege trying to uniquely pick out zero for
    his foundation of algebra. More pointedly: Why is content determinancy content
    important? We seem to have some algorithm which is more or less succesful.
2.  Indication *must* be *some* part of representation. For instance, my vision is
    undoutedly *indicates* to me what is directly in from of me. It's what happens
    after or with the indication, however. So: *How does inditication fit in with
    a full story about cognition?* 
3.  On the scripts and Shank and Abelson. The discussion during seminar made it seem
    like people were searching between a morphism between "the code" and human norms
    about restaurants. But I think that this is confusing for a number of reasons.
    First, in naturalistic terms, these human norms are "located" in our shared, repeated
    experience over time, but more crucially they're not a physical or fixed object
    that we can point to. Second, the morphism we're really looking for is with 
    "the code" and whatever the scientists decided were the present norms, or present
    norms sufficiently in-stone to merit inclusion in their script, perhaps their
    in the form of sentences like "first appetizers, second entree, third dessert, etc."
    Third, there is a level of abstraction between those sorts of sentences and
    the running machine, namely that just like "4" is translate to "100", "first
    appetizers" will have some bit-code representation. The relevant morphism, I think,
    is between the machine's code and the written down norms, the written down norms
    and the "actual norms."

### Brooks, "Intelligence without Representation"

#### Introduction

-   Artificial intellgience started as a field whose **goal** was to replicate
    human-level intelligence *in a machine*.
-   Early **hopes** fell as the magnitiude of the **problem** came to bear.
-   No one tries to replicate the full gamut of human intelligence anymore.
    -   "Specialized subproblems."
        -   Representing knowledge
        -   Natural language processing
        -   Vision
        -   Truth maintenance
        -   Plan verification

    -   The **hope** is that these systems "all fall in to place" to see
        a truly intelligent system **emerge**.

-   Brooks **believes** that human-level intelligence is too complex and little
    understood to be correctly decomposed into subpieces *at the moment*.
    -   **And** even if we knew the subpieces we still wouldn't know the *interface*
        between them.
    -   **And** we will never understand how to decompose human intelligence until
        we practice on lesser intelligences.

-   In this paper, Brookes **argues** for a different approach to creating AI:
    -   We must incrementally build up capabilities of intelligent systems, having
        *complete systems* at each step of the way.
        -   *Thus* automatically ensure that the pieces and their interfaces are *valid*.

    -   At each step we should build *complete* intelligent system that we let loose
        *in the real world* with *real sensing* and *real action*.
        -   Anything less provides a candidate with which we can delude ourselves.

-   Using this approach, they have come to an unexpected **conclusion** (C) and a
    radical **hypothesis** (H):

    > **(C)**: When we examine simple level intelligence we find that *explicit
    > representations* and models of the world *simply get in the way*. It turns out
    > to be better to use the world *as its own model*.
    >
    > **(H)**: *Representation* is the *wrong unit* of abstraction in building the
    > *bulkiest parts* of intelligent systems.

-   Representatino has been the **central ussue** in AI for the last 15 years only
    because it has provided an *interface* between otherwise isolated modules and
    conference papers.

#### The evolutino of intelligence

-   We already have the proof of intelligent beings: *human beings*.
    -   Some animals are intelligent to some degree.
    -   It's taken 4.6 billion year history.

-   It in *instructive* to *reflect* on the way in which earth-based biological evoltuion
    spent its time.

    Timeline | Evolutionary event
    ---------|-------------------
    3.5 BYA  | Single-cell entities arose out of primordial soup.
    2.5 BYA  | First photosynthetic cells appeared.
    550 MYA  | The first fish a vertabrates.
    450 MYA  | Insects
    370 MYA  | Reptiles
    330 MYA  | Dinosaurs
    250 MYA  | Mammals
    120 MYA  | Primates
    18  MYA  | Great apes
    2.5 MYA  | Humans in current form
    10,000 years | Agricultures
    5000 years   | Writing
    100 years | "Expert" knowledge

-   This **suggests** that problem solving behavior, language, expert knowledge,
    application, and reason are all pretty simple once the essence of **being**
    and **reacting** are available.
    -   This part of intelligence took evolution much longer, so it is much harder.

-   Brooks **believes** that mobility, acute vision, and the ability to carry out 
    survival related tasks in a dynamic environemtn provide a *necessary basis*
    for the *development of true intelligence*.

##### A story

-   Suppose it is the 1890s, where artificial flight is a glamor topic in science.
    -   A few artificial flight researches are magically transported to the 1980s
        for a medium duration flight on a Boeing 747.

-   Returning to the 1980s, they feel vigorated, knowing that flight is possible
    on a grand scale.
    -   They immediately set to work on duplicate what they have seen.
        -   Pitched seats
        -   Double-pane windows
        -   "Plastics"

#### Abstraction as a dengerous weapon

-   AI researchers are fond of pointing out that AI is denied its rightful successes.
    -   If nobody has any good idea of how to solve a particular problem, it becomes 
        known as an AI problem.
        -   When an algorithm developed by AI researches succesfully tackles the
            problem, AI detractors claim that since it was solvable by algorithm,
            it isn't an AI problem.

-   Brooks **claims** that AI researchers are guilt of the same self-deception.
    -   They partition the problems into two parts:
        -   The AI problems, which they solve.
        -   The non-AI problems, which they don't.

    -   Typically, AI "succeeds" by labelling the parts of problem they solve
        as "AI problems."
    -   "Abstraction" is used to discount problems of perception and motor skills.

-   Early work on AI concentrated on games, geometrical problems, symbolic algebra,
    theorem proving, and other formal systems.
    -   In each case, the semantics of the domains were fairly simple.

-   **Thus**, because we perform all the abstractions for our programs, AI work is
    still being done in block world.
    -   The blocks have slightly different shapes and colors.

-   *It could be* **argued** that performing perceptual abstraction is *merely* the
    normal reductionist use of abstraction common in all good science. Two
    **objections**:
    1.  Each animal species will have different *Merkwelt*.
        -    The human-assumed *Merkwelt* may not be valid.

        Merkwelt
        :   The merkwelt is a concept in robotics, ethology and biology that 
            describes a creature or android's capacity to view things, 
            manipulate information and synthesize to make meaning out of the 
            universe. In biology, for example, a shark's merkwelt for instance 
            is dominated by smell due to its enlarged olfactory lobes whilst a 
            bat's is dominated by its hearing, especially at ultrasonic frequencies.

    2.  It is by no means clear that such a *Merkwelt* is anything like what we
        actually use internally.

#### Incremental intelligence

-   Requirements on Creatures:
    -   Must *cope appropriately* to a *dynamic environment*.
    -   Must *be robust* (minor change in the world doesn't lead to total collapse).
    -   Must *maintain multiple goals*.
    -   Must *do something*, purpose in being.

##### Decomposition by function

-   Hardly anyone has ever connected a vision system to an intelligent central system.
-   One needs a long chain of modules to connect perception to action.

##### Decomposition by activity

-   Makes no distinction between peripheral and central systems.
    -   The fundamental slicing is in the "orthogonal direction" dividing it into
        *activity producing subsystems*.

#### The methodology, in practice

-   In order to build systems based on an activity decomposition, we must folow a 
    careful methodology.

##### Methodological maxim

-   **First**, test the Creatures in the real world.
    -   It is very easy to accidentally build a submodile of the system which happens
        to rely on some of those simplified properties.

-   **Second**, the system must interact with the real world over extended period.

##### An instatiation of the methodology

-   Layers
    1.  Avoid hitting objections
        -   Sonar
        -   Collide
        -   Feelforce
        -   Runaway
        -   Turn
        -   Forward

    2.  Wander
    3.  Try to explore, distant places
        -   Whenlook
        -   Pathplan
        -   Integrate

#### What this is not

1.  Connectionism
2.  Neural networks
3.  Production rules
4.  Blackboard
5.  German philosophy

#### Limits to growth

-   These machines operate completely autonomously in complex dynamic environments
    at the flick of their on switches, and continue until the batteries are drained.
    -   We **believe** they operate at alevel closer to simple insect level intelligence
        than to bacteria level intelligence.

-   Serious **questions**
    1.  How many layers can be built in the subsumption architecture before the
        interactions between layers become too complex to continue?
    2.  How complex can the behaviors be that are developed without the aid of central
        representation?
    3.  Can higher-level functions such as learning occur in the fixed topology networks
        of simple FSM.

### Wrapping up R-Representation

-   These are some examples of receptors that he mentions
    -   Structures in the frog's visual systems
        -   Bugs
        -   Flies
        -   Food
        -   BBs?

    -   These are nomically dependant on flies.
        -   When they're "triggered", it *causes* the flies tounge to pop out.
    
    -   Assuming they are representation, a good candidate for the content of the
        representation is *fly*.
        -   But any small dark and moving spot will cause this same effect.

    -   Also, edge-detectors in the visual system.
    -   Magnetosomes in the bacteria represent maybe:
        -   Magentic north
        -   Direction of oxygen-free water
        -   Direction of the nearest magent

    -   It's not clear what these represent because of content-indeterminancy.
        -   Usually theorists of this kind want to privilege a special kind of content.
        -   What's really important is that *food gets into the frog's stomach*.
        -   Maybe it's a fly, but it doesn't *really* matter so long as it's
            nutritious.

    -   *What's the biological function?*
        -   This doesn't seem to cut any more finely.

-   Suppose that the idea is you get food, there are many paths to getting food.
    -   People talking about getting the trout shodows, which, low and behold, you
        get the trout.
    -   *You get the food by representing BBs*.

-   There are all these issues about content.
    -   Are these even representatinos at all?

-   Dretske is trying to narrow down the content, 

### On Ben's presentation

-   The idea is our receptor representation and structural representation aren't
    very different, if one is a representation then why can't the other?
    -   S-representation is representation because:
        1.  Structural similarity, "isomorphism"
        2.  Use in *doing something cognitive*

    -   What are R-representations?
        -   Ramsey points out that these are *mere relays* and they're serving in the
            system *only as relays*, nomic dependancy.

-   There's no reason for these structures in the frog's brain or the magentosome's
    magnets, in these theories, these are playing an important role in *doing something
    cognitive*, something interpretation, it's "use that picks up the slack."
    -   Is this difference on the basis of content, is this sufficient to make on
        representatino and the other *not*. Couple of things to notice:
        1.  Are these really so different?
            -   Structural similarity vs. nomic dependancy.
            -   Take an internal map. Doesn't it *have to be some sort of nomic
                dependancy?* Various uses by the intelligent agent. *It can't be
                an accident that some structure is structually similar to the thing
                it represents.* That "causal embedding" is going to favor one
                interpretation over another.
            -   If you think about edge detectors, these are not attributed 
                *singularly*, they're in systems. Typically, they'll be *systems*
                of representatinos underly *systems* of (something).

-   If you remember Ramsey's argument, a lot of his examples are mechanical causal
    relays.
    -   If we *do* focus on mental representation cases, if we say that the receptor
        plays a role in a representation cognitive system, then it's playing
        a representation causal role.
        -   Ramsey's account of mental represnetation, to do something cognitive
            *just is* to interpret its inputs and outs as mental representations.

    -   Notice that this move *takes* IO-representation as *basic*.
        -   Then internal states that play a nomic dependancy role play a
            representational role.
        -   Nothing in the stomach or liver is doing something *recognizably
            cognitive*. This just *isn't* to treat as a cognitive system.

    -   This would be one way to go, piggyback R-representation on IO-representation.

-   If the thing is an adder, then it *has to be* that it's inputs are addends and
    outputs are sums.

-   There's *very little conceptual space* as saying it is doing something cognitive
    and that's its inputs and outputs are interprebable.

-   When I say I'm characterzing it as doing something cognitive, I'm talking 
    precisely, it's able to interpret speech, interpret 3-D scene, division, add.

-   If you characterize exactly what the system is, you'll get representation that
    just are inputs and outputs of representations that are interpreble.
    -   You see some system doing something fairly succesfully, the first job of the
        theorist is to characterize the competence.
        -   You have to see under what condition *it fails*. What *exactly* is the
            function it is computing.

-   We attribute capacties to systems
-   Rocks and walls do not have the necessary structure to represente addition, 
    *unless* you add indices for time.
-   Another way, go to the quantum level, there's lots of structure there.
-   How to understand the realization function, the way to think about that is
    specifying to causal
-   To push this a bit further, remember that a gene is certain physical structure 
    in the body and what's crucial is that it *causes* certain phenotypical
    effects, they are responsible for producing the realization's function.

-   You slipped in pragmatic, there are the phenomena we choose to explain, it seems
    to be doing something cogntive, I'm trying to interpret it, Searle's given me 
    a big book on how to do this.
-   It's important for us to develop a theory about what's cognitive, that's
    pragmatic.
    -   But what isn't is what a system needs to have the relevant features.

-   Dennet doesn't think this. The Dennet of the 70s is to systematically predict a
    system's behavior on the basis of intetion.
    -   The Dennet of the 80s and 90s has patterns in behavior, not patterns in the
        phenonmena.
        -   He thinks that beliefs and desires are abstracta.
        -   He denies the instrumentalist label, he rejects it.
        -   This is what the computational theory is c

### Niko's presentation

#### The Polemical Prologue

-   The general point is that Brooks believes that something has gone very wrong in the
    research of AI.
    -   It might have had more success if it didn't do this.
    -   He's discovered a better way.

-   In making in his case, he does a lot of things, he:
    -   Describes his robot
    -   German words
    -   Ant parable

##### A Dubious Parable

-   There are these artificial flight researches from the 1890s and their transported
    to the 1980s in a commercil airliner for the duration of a flight.
-   Upon returning to the 1980s, they focus their efforts on replicatin the seats and
    windows they observed on the airliner.
    -   Because the task of replicating the airliner seems so overwhelming, they become
        specialists in different areas.

-   The groups of researchers do not communcat well.
    -   They give up the study of aerodynamics entirely. Their propject is doomed to
        fail - they will never replicate the airliner.

##### A Potted History

-   We have this *proof of concept*, namely ourselves.

-   But this kind of specialiation, because it requires abstraction, is a form of 
    "self-delusion"
    -   AI researchers design program swhich can only operate on highly abstracted input
        represnetations.
    -   This approach ignores the really difficult problem of perfomring the
        abstractions in the first place.
    -   Brooks illustrates the failre of this kind of approach with the story of work
        on the "blocks world" in the 1960s and 1970s.
    -   This block world made it much easier for the machines to move around in this
        world, these robots would not function in real-life situations.

-   There is, moreover, an in-principle objection to abstraction: we have no reason
    to assume that the abstraction which seem most natural to us are anything like
    abstractions twhcih will be useful for a robotic system with very different
    sensory modaility; indeed, we have little reason to assume that our own cognition
    employs just the abstraction which seem most natural to us.

> What's the relatinship between theorizing and abstraction?

-   The way we come to abstractions we use is in designing these modules, he thinks
    basically "What data is salient to us" is a raw visual data stream, we think,
    "Oh, it's salient that there's a chair and it's folded."
    -   That this is introspectivesly relevant is important.

##### An Evolutionary Argument

-   **Premise**: Human-level intelligences have existed for a comparatively small
    proposition of the history of life, whereas simpler intelligences have not.
-   **Conclusion**: "This suggests that problem solving behavior, lagnauge, expert
    knowloedge and application, and reason, are all pretty simple once the essence
    of being and reacting are available."

> This is supposed to be relevant because designing low-level intelligence is important
> for investigating high-level systems.

##### A Diagnoises

-   The fundamental problem, Brooks suggests, is the approach to AI research by
    decomposition by function. 
    -   This apprach is characterized by the "traditional notion of ... a central
        system, with perceptual modules as inputs and action modules as outputs. The
        perceptual modules deliver a symbolic description of the world and the action 
        modules take a symbolic descrption of deisred acition and make sure they happen
        in the world. The central system is then a symbolic information processor."

> What's a decomposition *supposed to do*? This is supposed to be a better way to do.

-   **Ben**: For him, isn't he just trying to build intelligent creatures in building
    creatures that go around the office.
    -   His *goal* in finding a good decomposition, he's not trying to illuminate, he's
        trying to build a system that is intelligent.

-   Ths model allows groups working of differnt problems to make differnt assumption
    about the "shape of the symbolic interfaces", which in teun makes those inferfaces
    "subject to intellectual abuse". Brooks think this apporach is unlikely to result
    in the development of integrated intelligent systems.

##### Questions

1.  Does Brook's history of AI research point on *in-principle* problem with the
    decomposition by function approach? If not, does it support his case? Is his
    parable, which seems almost fatalistic, entirely fair?

    > How is it not going to scale up? It's not going to scale up to the messiness of
    > the dynamic, changing world. This is the problem with traiditional AI. So it's
    > a disanalogy with the AI researchers.

    > Maybe these guys a decomposing the functional subsystems badly.

2.  What of the alleged in-principle objection to the decomposition by function
    approach? Whose cares whether there might be some intelligent systems which
    couldn't function using the abstractions most natural to us? Might it still
    be the case fhat some intelligent system can, and that the decomposition by 
    function apporach could allows us to deisgn them? Why think there might be some
    tight connection between senory modalities useful abstraction to the first place?
3.  Is the evolutionary argument any good? **Compare**: Space flight has existed
    for compataively small proportion of the history of *homo sapiens*, whereas
    agriculture has not. This suggest spaceflight is easy once you have agriculture.
4.  What does any of this have to do with prescnec or absence of representation?

#### Meet the Robots

##### Decomposition by Activity

-   To replace the problmatic apporach of decomposition by function, Brooks suggests an
    approach by decompistion by activity.
    -   The idea is that each activity of a system should be controlled by an
        indepedant subsystem.
    -   One such layer might cause a robot to avoid colliding with objects.

-   Once one system is in place, further, indepedant systems are added which interact
    in such a way as to produce desirable behavior. 
    -   The systems are not entirely autonomous, since theye have to coordinate 
        the robot's overall behavior, but there is no central control system.

##### No Representations

-   Brooks claims that a robot designed according to his principles does not need to
    employ any representations

    > We do claim however, that there need be no explicit representation of either 
    > the world or the intentions of the system to generate intelligent behaviors 
    > for a Creature. Without such explicit representations, and when viewed locally, 
    > the interactions may indeed seem chaotic and without purpose.

##### Description of a Model Robot

> Each layer is made of a bunch of FSMs which each operate semi-indepedantly and
> has access to a central processor, and it's arranged of three layers.
> 
> 1.  The simplest
>     -   Avoids colliding with things

> 2.  Also looks at the data (actually not sure), but its purpose is to make the
>     robot wander aound. 
> 3.  Seems to always override the second layer, and this layer takes in the data
>     from the sonar and finds places that are distant from the robot and finds the
>     path from the place, but when there is an object, the third layer recalculates
>     a new path, the capacity of the third level is to *explore*.

-   The different layers of the model robot are composed of networks of FSM.
    -   Each such FSM has timers and access to computational machines "which can
        compute things such a vector sums."

-   The model robot has a ring of sonars around its circuference which serve as it
    sensors.
    -   The lowest layer of the robot makes it avoid hitting objects.
        -   It does this by running its sonors "and every second emitting an 
            instantaneous map with the readings converted to polar coordinates."

    -   The map gets passed on to some other machines, which determine whether an
        object is too close, and if so, cause the robot to move in the opposite
        direction

-   The second layer of the robot makes it wander waround by generating random headings
    and interfacing with the first layer.
    -   The third layer makes the robot try to reach distant places by choosing
        locations and continually calculating paths for the robot it is forced to
        avoid an obstacle.

##### Questions

-   Is Brook's claim that his robots do not employ any explicit representations 
    plausible? If he is correct, how can he help himself to descriptions of the layers
    as computing vecto sums, emitting a map witht e readins converted to polar 
    coordinates, etc.?

### Response

-   There as to be enviromental richness.
-   There were two problem that stymied research:
    1.  Knowledge-representation problem
        :   If you're building a system for the real-world, it's got to *know a lot*.

        -   Last time we talked about about Shank scripts, the device has a paradigm
            of what it's like to go to a restaurant, and it's supposed to answer
            questions about people in this scenario, and there was a lot that it
            couldn't answer, like people sit on chairs and not on the floor, that
            wasn't in it's knowledge base, and of course we know that.
        -   The problem of structure or representing in some way all of the knowledge
            that the system has to have to get around in the world and the knowledge has
            to be represented in a way the system can get it.
        -   This is related to the problem of designing a machine that can pass the
            Turing-test, and any bit of esoteric information can become relevant
            by a shift in context, and this machine has to have this information
            accesible.
        -   If you got an artificial, well-defined, then scaling up to the real world 
            requires a lot of information.

    2.  Frame or relevance problem
        :   The world changes from one minute to the next, but it really only has to
            notice the relvant changes, and the system would be overwhelmed if it
            took account for *every possible change*.

            For instance, the lighting in the room is affecting our shadows and were
            affecting the ambient tempurature, and the system has to represent the
            relevance from irrelevant changes. We do this.

            Combinatorial explosion.

-   Brooks has some suggestions for building things in the real world. He does say
    that his robots have no representations at all. What seems to be the case is theres
    no explicit, general, context-free representation, that's the kind of representation
    that it *doesn't have*. 
    -   What are perceived, but doesn't stress to much in this paper, because each
        layer is intended to have it's own proprietary sensory mechanisms, these are
        tied to the goals of the system, what's perceived by each layer are 
        "oppurtunities for action."
        -   The analogy here, the father here of what the system perceives things
            which *invite doing certain things*, this idea comes from JJ Gibson's
            Affordances.
        -   He thought what the visual system detects are complex properties which are
            salient to speicific kinds of organisms.
        -   When you perceive a knife, you see something which can cut. Food, we see it
            as something which is *ripe for eating*.
        -   Gibson thought that these were the objects for perception.
        -   This idea is going to be pretty influential in embodied cognition, people
            talking about representations that are action-oriented, not a passive 
            conditino of the world but as serving some sort of goal.

> To be clear, we have this perceptual system and one reason it makes the disctinctions
> it does make is that it partitions the world in such a way that is useful, or, that
> we perceive things as purposeful, which is *adding content to the perception*. It's
> like sayin "Why do we lump objects in the ways we do?"

-   Gibson thought that properties like affording cutting, like the knife, is that
    *what we see* is an object for cutting, and this structures the light in certain
    ways. We *literraly perceive* them, it isn't *categorizing*.
    -   Food, for humans, there are higher-order invariance in the light, and that
        food strctures the light in a certain way that our visual system was built
        to detect.

-   The idea is then that this is how these layers "cut things differently" and it's
    partly perceptual, partly cognitive.
    -   What it's perceiving affordances in the environment, oppurtunities to do
        something in the world.

-   The lowest level

> a disconnect, the way we're talking about things being intermingled.

-   They're sensing properties which are then processing in the FSMs, and this
    is directing behavior by the things detecting things by those sensors.

> How tight and how exactly?

-   All I can do is repeat.
-   If you think about what is being perceived by these various sensors are properties
    of this thing that is relevant to the action by the layer that this action is going
    to produce. 
    -   The bottom layer sensors are not going to sense the coke cans, because that's
        not relevant to the activity of avoiding obstacles.
    -   Each sense organ at a particular layer is going to detect things which are
        relevant to *that layer*.

-   The **take-away** message is that what is perceived is not bare properties of things
    but stuff that is instricinally linked to oppurtunties for behavior.
-   Using the world as its own model (third point, unexpected conclusion)

### Clark and Chalmers, "The Extended Mind"; 

#### Introduction

> Where does the mind stop and rest of the world begin?

-   There are two replies
    -   The "skin and skull."
    -   It "just ain't in the head."

-   Clark and Chalmers propose a very different sort of externalism, *active 
    externalism*
    -   It's "based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive
        processes."

#### Extended Cognitive

-   Consider three cases of human problem solving:
    1.  A person mentally rotates a two-dimensional shapes and is asked
        question concerning fit.
    2.  A person can mentally rotate the shape *or* press the rotate button.
    3.  A person can mentally rotate the shape or let their cognitive implant
        do it.

-   How much *cognition* is present in these case?
    -   If the rotation in case (3) is cognitive, by what right do we count case (2)
        as fundamentally different?

-   We often rely on external computing resources.
    -   Pen and paper long multiplication.
    -   Physical re-arragnments of letter tiles to prompt word recall.
    -   Instruments such as the nautical slide rule.
    -   General paraphenrnalia of:
        -   Language
        -   Books
        -   Diagrams
        -   Culture

-   In fact, these cases can be very real. (1) and (2) are options in the computer
    game Tetris.
    -   Two types of actions

        Epistemic action
        :   Alter the world so as to aid and augment cognitive processes such as
            recognition and search.

        :   Demands spread of *epistemic credit*.

        Pragmatic action
        :   Alter the world because some physical change is desirable for

#### Active Externalism

-   The human organism is linked with an external entity in a two-way interaction,
    creating a *coupled system* that can be seen as a cogntive system in its
    own right.
    -   Al the components in the system play an active causal role.

### Aizawa, "Extended Cognition"

March 11th, 2014 <small>Seminar</small>
---------------------------------------

### Set up of Clark & Chalmers

-   A lot of diversity, but this is only on Clark and Chalmers.

HEC

:   Cognitive processes *litterally extends* into the enviroment surrounding the
    organism, and human cognitive states literally comporse.

:   Cognitive processes are implemented/realized/constituted by processes in the
    brain, body, and world. (Note not *can be*.)

HEMC

:   Cognitive processes depend on external ...

> There is a difference between human cognition and cognition *simpliciter*.

-   Two things we need for discussion:
    1.  A distinction between causation and constitution.
    2.  Some understanding of "cognitive processes."

-   A standard picture of contiion is that it's *among the factors* that *drive*
    behavior.
    -   Another part is *physical capacities*.

-   These guys are calling *behavior* is extended, but of course everyone thinks that.
    -   We want to know wehther *cognition* is extended.

-   If you mean by cognitive the term "information processing", then of course its
    extended as well, because you can gather information from your environment.

> Why do you think that the game is over when cognition becomes behavior?

-   **Take-away**: This is not old-fashioned, bad methodology, this is just, what
    do you mean when you talk about cognition.

-   There are two kinds of arguments:
    1.  Cogntive equivilence arguments
    2.  Coupling arguments

> 1.  What are psychologists doing?
>     -   Should they be doing that?

> 2.  What do the folk think?
> 3.  What are the metaphysical joints?

[^1]: I don't understand when you're "supposed to stop describing" for a
    closed system. I see that account (4) stops describing when the
    internal state of the computer comes to be required to continue
    explaining, but I don't understand why in account (3), supposedly
    "closed", you don't say that bits come to be charged via
    electricity, for instance.

    I think that even account (1), (2), and (3) really require an
    arbitrarily large conjunction of state description to be "closed."

[^2]: I want to know what a biological or neurological taxonomy of types
    would look like -- our ability to type artifacts and concepts seems
    sufficiently general that "anything can fit in the bin", that is we
    can store tokens of mountains and transcendental idealism -- if
    token couldn't be contained in any of our brain's possible types,
    would we be in a position to know?

[^3]: If we map the structural, syntatical, and semantical features of
    the way we *talk about* beliefs states and agents and doxastic 
    attitudes, the former is accesible to us and the latter is 
    inaccesible. But if we find a feature of the former we can reasonable
    map it to the latter.

    Often logic is called "the norms of believing." Does this pose a
    problem because logic is a norm of reasoning and we commonly don't
    reason well, via the affirming the consequent result, then maybe
    we can't move from one to the other.

    If we discover a mental structure which *conflicts* with logical
    structure, like for instance affirming the consequent being so
    common, should we affirm the consequent *more often* as a result?
    Alternatively, does it raise the perceived reliability of the
    seeming invalid (from a logical point-of-view) mental structure?
    If folk psychology is *generally valid* and we want to *vindicate*
    it, and actual, empirical mental structures follow invalid logical
    syntax, does that mean we want to vindicate invalid logical syntax
    too?

[^4]: Are the rules of logic the norms of reasoning? Are the rules of logic
    pre-existing intuitions systemitized?

[^5]: Only with regards *to fitness*.

[^6]: There is no "primtive", I think, in geometry. A point can be expressed in
    terms of a line or a plain. A line can be expressed in terms of two points or
    a part of a plain. A plain can be expressed in terms of 3 lines or 3 points.

[^7]: I think that this may relate to debates in epistemology about brains in vats.
    So, here's an argument for thinking that they are related issues, and then
    I'll give an additional argument for how one might give insight to the other.

    Assume that the brain represents its environment. Cummins thinks that a
    representation can represent all content with which it is isomorphic.
    Ramsey thinks that the content that matters is what *this* brain is using *now*.
    What's at issue in brain-in-vat skeptical arguments is that the brain's
    internal representation is isomorphic with both what the realist wants to
    call objective reality and what the skeptic wants to call "brain-in-vat land"
    (or the images that the vat is giving the brain or something). What's problematic
    about the brain-in-vat skeptical concerns is that the internal represnetation
    is isomorophic with both pictures.

    So how is this insightful? Well. Actually. In hindsight, I'm not sure, I'd have
    to think about it. I think this succesfully relates the issues. Ramsey's solution
    to BIV challenges might be that the most explantory useful theory, because
    objective reality is what *this* brain is using *now* or something ...

[^8]: It's not that we don't know what representation is or that there is no
    representation, but rather, it's that representation with regards to
    cognizing if a fuzzy and poorly understood.

[^9]: There's a paradox of analysis here. Where on one hand, cogntive theorists and
    any competent user of English knows what a representation *is*, we use them all
    the time. There are only two possibilities: We know what representation is or we
    do not. If we do, then we need to "check what's in the head" and see if it's a
    representation. If we don't, what's the use of writing a book on it? To clarify
    what we could possibly mean by a "mental model" or "mental representation"? We
    don't know what representation is *in general*, nevermind whether they can be in the
    head.

[^10]: "We don't care what if you understand what representation *is*, we do, and that's
    one." When scientists do this, or where scientists could possibly do this in other
    fields, you can still ask them where the representation *is* and *how* it represents.

    The computer scientist can tell you that the letter on a screen is represented by
    the computer's software as an ASCII character with the numbers 1 through 64 (or
    something) and that those numbers are represented on the computers hardware with
    many, many on-off switches. On-off switches do no equal represented numbers
    and represented numbers are not represented letters, but they all share an
    resemblance that can be exploited.

    What *I* want to know is can the cognitive scientist take a cognizers utterance
    of some state, say "I am hungry", and use folk psychology to say that the utterance
    is a represents the utterer's inner state, and if you look at the inner state
    you'll find the processes by which the brain finds out and stores facts about
    the body (but more generally the non-mind world).  

[^11]: I think what's confusing here is that the isomorphism being exploited is
    not a relation between the data structures and human norms about restauraunts,
    but rather between the input stories and the "background knowledge" data structures.

[^12]: *Of course* (I think) it's real and we're not just assigning something to
    physics. You can raise skeptical or linguistic or Wittgensteinian worries
    about words and how we use them, and in fact I think within the realm of
    those worries you might be right. But the present project is not trying to
    resolve worries about reductionism or scientism or realism - I think that
    just as someone who studies grains of sand can grant that there is some 
    ambiguity about heaps, but when you see a heap of sand you very well know
    it's a heap of sand. By the same reasoning, I'm okay with being unsure if I
    can escape that with regards to the ontology of conciousness whether or not
    there is a brain with a mind or just a series of atoms, but when I'm
    reasoning about the mind I can put that worry aside. "Keep your metaphysics
    and linguistics out of my philosophy of mind."

    (Doesn't sound very strong, I know.)
