### Chapter 4 of *Utilitarianism*

1.  Objectivity of judgement about "good."
2.  Teleological - end, goal of action "good." Deontological, right
    (abstract principle)

-   The first argument you see in Moore is that Mill is just arbitrarily
    defining good as pleasure in *Principa Ethica*.
-   "Naturalistic fallacy" Mill is arbitrarily defining "good" as
    "desirable" and this is the "open question" fallacy.
-   -   This has to do with prescription versus description, of is
        versus ought, and specifically, visible versus desirable.

-   In *System of Logic*, Mill says one must avoid the problems of is
    and ought. Therefore, Mill was aware of this distinction, as he
    wrote System of Logic before *Utilitarianism*.
-   The word "good" designates a non-natural property.
-   "Desire" is the only evidence that's possible of the presence of
    good.

### Naturalism and Empiricism

-   Mill has been called and is both.
-   The account of logic in empiricist terms, for Mill, logical truth
    and mathematical truth is a species of empirical truth. (Science)
-   How do you acquire truth about nature? Observation, deduction, etc.
-   How do you acquire truth about philosophy? Induction
-   If goodness or rightness non-natural properties in the sense that
    they cannot be experienced by any of the senses, then there is no
    way of knowing if anything is good or right.
-   The only means we have to determine if anything is good or right is
    induction because Mill has ruled out deduction.
-   Mill needs some way to experience the non-natural property of
    goodness or rightness through one of the senses.

-   Hedonism
    -   Full
        -   Full, or absolute hedonism is the claim that happiness and
            the avoidance of pain is the only motivator for people, that
            there is no other value.
        -   If it has independent value, it must be part of pleasure.
        -   Everything of value is either pleasurable or part of
            pleasure.

    -   Restricted
        -   The alternative is restricted or qualified hedonism
        -   This is less ambitious, and all the Mill needs, evidently.

    -   Pleasure
        -   Mill is a naturalist and pleasure is a natural state of
            human mind, it's natural for human beings to be able to
            experience mental pleasure.
        -   For instance, contemplating a truth or performing noble
            actions.
        -   What Mill means by pleasure is a sensation.

-   Mill's ontology
    -   Naturalism, the elements accepted by natural science.
    -   Not a reductionist, minds are just as real as bodies.
    -   Pleasure kinds
        -   Sensations
        -   Mental states - thoughts of concepts

> The dominant paradigm of philosophy of mind is now cognitive science
> from models from the computer, based on different states of on and
> off, the transitions which are governed by some laws. In the case of
> computer, it would be laws of logic, etc. To use an analogy, there is
> a distinction between software and hardware: just like a thought is
> not equal to the brain state which gave rise to it, a program model of
> data is not equal to the state of equipment which powers it.

-   Fools
    -   Why are there fools?
        -   Poor socialization, education
        -   Physiologically, nutrition

    -   Is the fool blameworthy?
    -   What makes it wrong to judge value the way the fool does?
    -   If someone can be a fool and legitimately value intrinsically
        lower pleasures, why can't someone be an egotistic hedonist?
        Someone who values their own pleasure and no one else's.
    -   Mill is committed to the idea that there is an objective correct
        answer about what is more pleasurable.

-   Ideal of character
    -   Someone who is physiologically normal and has cognitive
        function, someone who should be able to derive pleasure from
        moral equality

-   Egoists
    -   There is something that the fool and the egoist have in common.
        1. Accepts the sum (aggregate) of individual utilities. 2. But
        denies impartiality

------------------

-   On Liberty and Utilitarianism are largely interconnected and a
    distinction between political and moral philosophical works is not
    useful and misleading.
-   the major concern of the book is to develop a theory about the
    crucial importance of freedom and action.
-   It is impossible to separate the well being of society as whole from
    the well being of the individual.
-   Mill wants to argue that if you want to understand the mature of
    human well being for individual or society as a whole, you have to
    understand the role of the freedom of in thought and action in the
    development of man's activities.
-   Because of our nature as developmental beings, we need freedom.
-   Mill's doctrine was radical for the mid to late 19th century, but
    now this is accepted.
-   if you were to diagram the possibilities according to political
    philosophy in the last two centuries or so, you have on one extreme
    the general category of liberalism and on the other, conservatism.
-   what distinguishes these is the commitment to contrasting values,
    freedom of the individual, as opposed to social order and stability.
-   the cornerstone of civilized society lies upon custom a tradition.
    (Conservatism)
-   people like Edmond burke defend custom and tradition and argue that
    human beings are unable to know very much about what can and cannot
    work about the activities of human beings, but what survives the
    test of time is proof of what is good, avoids subversive elements.
-   people who reject the standard values of church and monarchy are
    trying to disrupt society.
-   burke would say that society had to defend order and safety by
    repressing the freedom of individuals.
-   mill is writing in this intolerant atmosphere.
-   when this dichotomy begins to develop,
-   what makes on liberty so canonical is allow room for both freedom
    and order both liberal and conservative values.
-   mill recognizes fully and clearly the need for social order and
    stability and predictability, but he tries to argue that the more
    freedom we allow individuals, the more benefits society has and the
    more avidity that society has to provide order and stability and
    safety and what have you.
-   these things are complementary, mill believes.
-   mill endorses freedom over social order because he think the freedom
    brings about social order
-   the work is not about political freedom, but rather the freedom of
    the individual to live as he pleases, under certain constraints.
-   three basic principles: 1. Liberty, 2. Autonomy, and 3. Harm
-   mill is writing for a highly repressive and orthodox homogenous
    culture composed of christians and whites and highly stratified
    society and values order and stability and is highly regimented and
    there are extremely explicit norms for everyone to obey a out what
    now call lifestyle, sexuality, hobbies, private interests,
-   the cultivation of individuality at that time was struck most of the
    leaders as subversive
-   the word that mill uses still has overtones of 19th century attitude
    about individualism, eccentricity
-   the work promoted a great deal of outrage and hostility because they
    saw mill as attack social order by encouraging selfish behavior and
    private interests, for being different for its own sake in a culture
    that values conformity for its own sake,
-   individuals ought to cultivate their selves, the dominant ideology
    in the west, we live as grandchildren mills doctrine.
-   what is the major threat? Not political tyranny. It is the tyranny
    of society, mill uses the term from Tocqueville, democracy in
    america, "tyranny of the majority‚Äù
-   this is the warning that he and his wife give in on liberty.
-   that too much conformity is dangerous for society, and that allowing
    individuals liberty can benefit society and lead to more stability
-   mill is not concerned with government power as such, but in chapter
    5 we will see how to best use freedom for the individual to promote
    ones own private happiness which encourages the public happiness as
    well.
-   the way that mill frames is the stark opposition, the choice that
    has to be made between eccentricity, which did not have the
    psychological overtones that it does now, the way that this term is
    used is someone who is psychologically a bit abnormal, not someone
    who has cultivated his own taste and values, but someone whose
    psychological function has violated the proper bounds of normal
    function.
-   we have psychologized something that is crucial to the individual
-   the word diversity is much more neutral
-   we now take this for granted, the value of toleration, the term
    pluralism, a diversity of beliefs and lifestyles and interest and
    the like, reflecting pele's individualities of peoples characters
    and interest and outlook and diversity of views and opinions and
    theories.
-   as liberalism develops after mills time, it becomes associated with
    a positive accepting attitude of lifestyles, receptive toward the
    unknown, toward the novel, the unorthodox, and a rejection the
    customary and the traditional and the like.
-   Burke is the "uber-conservative", god kings, beaugoursie, peasant,
    serf,
-   when mill writes about a century later, a hostility towards the
    novel is deeply intrenched in continental thought
-   add to this the development of natural faculties. Which he describes
    in chapter
-   the way mill characterizes the harm opposed upon society by not
    allowing greater individual freedom, society becomes threatened by
    stagnation.
-   the liberty principle holds that each person should enjoy the same
    basic right of freedom and thought and action.
-   freedom of thought should be absolutely
-   we ought to value the freedom of the individuals.
-   the autonomy principles dictates how we should use this freedom.
-   this is meant to hold true for human beings in their full rational
    state.
-   this is an application of the role of development
-   mill sees Britain as civilized because its becoming one of the core
    values of England that human beings are morally equal
-   equal rights in the interest of others,
-   people ought to be treated as equals
-   everyone, not just males or Christians or the wealthy or whatever
    should've treated as equals
-   these are conditions that re now being realized in the more
    civilized community of then19th century, of which the sun never sets
-   human beings that have mature or developed faculties are now
    becoming the norm
-   if you know anything about mills personal life, he served parliament
    on behalf of the middle class because he believed that the
    economical and social arrangements of middle class England would
    encourage everyone developmental faculties aristocracy
-   you have to consider always everything mill says is predicated on
    mills view of human nature and societies develop insofar as their
    individuals development, they codevelop
-   since human beings are social creature anyway, the more an
    individual cultivates his talents and skills, the more others can,
    it's reciprocal
-   the point is that mill is developing the limitation of the freedom
    of thought and freedom of action
-   one restriction is that it does not apply to children
-   you must have reached a minimum level of human functioning
-   this is spry of his naturalism
-   the human animal is one that exhibits a range of his faculties,
    cognitive moral, etc, and we have relativity clear standards of
    forms of function, which children fail to meet those stand;adds, the
    insane do as well.

Chapter 5 of *Utilitarianism* - Of the Connection between Justice and Utility [(Adapted from)](http://www.personal.kent.edu/~jwattles/mill.htm)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can utilitarianism provide sturdy principles of rights and justice?
Justice, whose requirements operate in apparent indifference to
happiness, is ultimately best understood in utilitarian terms.

1.  The idea of justice
    -   Justice seems to be an inherently absolute concern, unrelated to
        expediency, utility, or the greatest happiness principle. We
        need to inquire regarding this natural and strong feeling.
    -   Is there any one characteristic common to all modes of
        injustice? Consider is it unjust to:
        1.  deprive someone of his legal rights to liberty and property
            (unless he has forfeited them);
        2.  deprive someone of that to which he has a moral right;
        3.  to deprive someone of that which he deserves (e.g., by
            failing to return a favor);
        4.  to break faith with someone, for example by breaking a
            promise; to be [unjustifiably] partial.

    -   The concept of impartiality is associated with equality (except
        when inequalities are deemed expedient.\
    -   It is not easy to see what the preceding "applications" of
        justice have in common.\
    -   Etymologies indicate that the core notion of justice is
        conformity to law.\
    -   Even in society regarding matters when we would not propose
        legislation, the notion of [quasi-legal] enforcement is in the
        background.\
    -   To call something wrong (as opposed to merely disapproving of
        it) implies that it should be punished by law, opinion, or
        conscience.\
    -   "Perfect" duties (unlike imperfect duties, e.g., of beneficence)
        give rise to correlative rights. An assignable person is
        wronged.

2.  The Feeling of Justice
    -   Now we are ready to inquire into the feeling of justice. The
        sentiment (as distinct from what is moral in it) does not arise
        from an idea of expediency.
    -   It has two essential ingredients: the desire to punish the
        wrongdoer (based on natural or instinctive responses of
        self-defense and sympathy) plus the belief that someone has been
        harmed.\
    -   Humans (unlike animals) are capable of extended sympathy and of
        understanding of how their own interests and those of the
        community are linked.\
    -   Moral resentment is attuned to the general good (Kant, e.g., is
        to be interpreted in this way). In sum, the idea of justice
        presupposes

        1.  a rule (for the general good); and
        2.  a sentiment in favor of punishment.

3.  Rights and Alternatives
    -   The importance of rights
        -   A right implies a valid claim on society to protect [someone
            or some group] or to provide some good by law or education
            of opinion.\
        -   Rights have utilitarian validation; the intensity of feeling
            is due to the importance of the security at stake.

    -   Alternative theories
        -   One alternative theory is that justice is independent of
            utility and discerned by simple introspection--which,
            however, is notoriously ambiguous and variable and is just
            as much in dispute as utility is.\
        -   Various conflicting theories of punishment have a certain
            plausibility considered in isolation (and perhaps for
            certain types of case).\
        -   Some theories of justice place emphasis on the freedom of
            the will of the agent held responsible; others emphasize the
            social contract (broken by unjust conduct); others regard
            punishment as a means to deter unlawful conduct.\
        -   Views differ on how to determine the extent of
            punishment--an eye for an eye? Should the gravity of the
            offense determine it? Should remuneration be distributed on
            the basis of effort or contribution?\
        -   Utility alone can decide. Questions of taxation may also be
            treated from various standpoints--and utilitarianism alone
            can resolve the disputes.

4.  Conclusion
    -   Justice is of supreme importance, since it pertains to the most
        absolute of obligations: the rules against hurting and
        interfering with the liberty of others.\
    -   To abandon such rules is to regress to the [misery of the
        anarchy of the] state of nature. Thus [perfect] duties are much
        more crucial than [imperfect] duties.
    -   The intensity of the sentiment of justice is explained by the
        intensities of feeling understandably associated with the
        components.\
    -   Most (specific) maxims of justice are instrumental to the
        previously noted principles.\
    -   Equality--except where it is inexpedient--each person's having
        an equal claim to happiness--is the heart of utilitarianism.\
    -   And social progress has unmasked the disutility of inequalities
        and will continue to do so regarding the false "aristocracies of
        color, race, and sex".\
    -   "Justice" covers the most useful social rules (which do admit of
        exceptions). Hence the proof in favor of utilitarianism is
        complete.

Mill‚Äôs Considerations on Representative Government (1860) by Professor Colby
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are some basic principles espoused in the work and which
are in the background of On Liberty. The labels for principles 1 through
5 are my own since Mill does not explicitly label them.

1.  The Principle of Political Naturalism: All political institutions
    are created by human beings through voluntary agency.
2.  The Principle of Political Relativity: Political institutions must
    be adjusted to the specific capacities and levels of development of
    those capacities of human beings in specific political and
    historical circumstances (e.g., despotic rule is best for a
    primitive tribe or barbaric culture).
3.  The Principle of Political Evaluation: Government is only a means to
    the end of human development; we must choose between better and
    worse means, hence between better and worse forms of government.
4.  The Principle of Political Development: Causes and conditions of
    good government consist in
    1.  the moral and intellectual development of the governed and
    2.  the improvement of the governed (development of all citizens‚Äô
        potential through participation); hence Mill endorses two
        criteria for evaluating forms of government:
        -   improvement of the moral and intellectual character of the
            governed and
        -   full use of the capacities and talents of the governed.
            Government should not be a neutral instrument to keep the
            peace, but an active agency of intellectual and moral
            development.

5.  The Principle of Political Co-development: Since government must
    improve the character of the governed, and government must adjust to
    the level of development of the governed, as the character of the
    governed improves, the form of government must also improve: co-
    development of governed and government itself. Hence government
    should not be merely an active agency but also a reactive agency,
    responding to changes in the intellectual and moral capacities of
    the governed.
6.  Mill‚Äôs political ideal: direct participation by all in political
    power and self-government, which is impossible as a practical matter
    (at least in the short term), necessitating representative
    government through elected deputies.
7.  Representative government has two defects:
    -   incompetence: it is not competent to pass laws directly (so it
        should instead select an elite of specially qualified,
        non-political individuals to draft legislation it would approve
        and reject or return such legislation to this commission, and it
        should promote public opinion to debate conflicting views) and
    -   its legislation is class based.

8.  Every adult should have the right to vote, but votes should not be
    equal. Political equality as practiced in America is harmful to
    intellectual and moral excellence (he liked the aphorism, ‚ÄúSome are
    wise, and some are otherwise‚Äù); mental superiority (measured through
    educational attainments or occupation) should warrant plural votes.
    Mill accepts the classical view of politics in which ethics and
    politics must be integrated and also accepts its rejection of equal
    political freedom for all citizens.
9.  ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù for Mill means popular sovereignty (the governed are the
    ultimate source of political authority, as with Hobbes and Kant),
    direct participation by the governed in their own governance; in
    popular government (democracy as opposed to aristocracy, etc.), the
    special interests of a numerical majority displace the common
    interest; natural tendency is toward collective mediocrity, which
    extending the franchise would only intensify.
    -   false democracy (e.g., America): each citizen has equal
        political authority (one man, one vote), (2) majority rule
        (political decisions are determined by a numerical majority):
        tyranny of public opinion, disenfranchised minorities,
        government of privilege and special interest of the majority,
        not general interest of all
    -   true democracy: adequate representation of minorities so that
        all interest groups have representation in proportion to their
        numbers (especially the educated, middle-class minority),
        multiple clashing interests to counterpose the tyranny of the
        majority or domination of any one group to ensure social
        progress, elite rules with consent of the governed in general
        interest of all (the two interests in modern society are capital
        and labor, which should be equally balanced in the government so
        neither can dominate the other)

10. Mill praises the virtues of popular government (democracy) but
    restricts it: people rule through their representatives; he supports
    extending the franchise but with qualifications: reading, writing,
    calculating, and paying direct taxes (not receiving ‚Äúrelief‚Äù or
    welfare, hence not financially dependent on the community); plural
    voting so that elections are weighted; proportional representation
    ensures that minorities elect representatives of their choice.
11. Mill‚Äôs ultimate political principle: the good of the governed, not
    the will of the governed, determined by the mentally superior with
    the rational consent of the governed.

-------------------

### Chapter 1 of *On Liberty*

-   There is an ethnological foundation of Mill's theories
    -   Cognitive
    -   Affective
    -   Social

-   You have to start with some conception of the type of target or
    audience to whom the work is addressed, and what type of ideals they
    ought to pursue according to the theory.
-   For Mill, this is Utility.
-   This is for the beings who have this range of normal functions.
-   If the theory is going to be a practical guide, then it has to be a
    guide aimed at the general population.
-   The theory has to account for why it excludes the populations it
    does.
-   **Dan**: I get this notion that not letting people who are
    irresponsive to reason into a conversation, but who is allowed to
    arbitrate this? For instance, someone who believes in homeopathy may
    be responsive to reason on some issues, but definitely not on
    others.
    -   What matters is identifying the different faculties or
        capacities that constitute normal human nature.
    -   Before you identify homeopathy as problematic, you need to
        identify the relevant human faculty, in this case, the human
        mind.
    -   If you follow this method of beginning with standard, least
        problematic cases:
        -   Self awareness
        -   Awareness
        -   Sense of self
        -   Sense of others
        -   Language
        -   Cognitive
        -   Memory
        -   Affect
        -   Social
        -   Accountability

    -   He is not specific about this criteria (Mill), but he is
        specific enough to craft an answer.
    -   **Dan**: I think I also see that is that if you take a 3 year
        old and a college professor, one will be usually be reasonable
        and the other will not be, who gets to judge?
    -   Response: This still admits to a set of criteria which can be
        used to determine who is under the umbrella of the theory.
    -   Fallacy of quibbling
    -   No theory can be complete
    -   I'll get in chapter 2 to what beliefs are rational.
    -   **Dan**: Under what has be said here thus far, it basically says
        nothing. All it says is that some people you can tyrannize and
        some people you can't, and it's a nothing statement, it's
        vacuous. He gives a qualifying principle for that, but he gives
        you the criteria to include or exclude everyone.

-   What should a moral theory look like?
    -   Should it be entirely a prior?
    -   Should it be entirely empirical?
    -   Or a hybrid of the two?

-   This is a doctrine that provides norms of conduct for a community of
    civilized functioning adults.
-   You're supposed to share these rules of moral conduct.
-   These are not explicitly named in the book, but they are proper
    names:
    -   The Liberty Principle
        -   We ought to value liberty, freedom.
        -   Liberty of thought and action.

    -   The Autonomy Principle
        -   This tells us how we should use liberty.
        -   We shouldn't use it to conquer the world
        -   We should use it to promote self development
            (individuality), the cultivation of faculties.

    -   The Harm Principle
        -   When the society have the legitimate reasons to intervene,
            either by force or public opinion

-   You have to keep in mind something about Mill's theory which I
    mentioned several times, which is what you said, his theory is
    developmental, it's a mistake to, lets say, classify someone as
    irrational based only on one timeslice, on one moment in that
    person's life, because what's involved is faculties and abilities,
    and the faculty of reason is not one which holds various beliefs as
    true, but rather, it is a range of different skills, forming beliefs
    and opinions, weighing them, learning about alternatives, and this
    is what Chapter 2 is.
-   Belief in homeopathy might be rational in terms of a persons earlier
    beliefs and later beliefs, this is what makes Mill's theory hard to
    evaluate, people are in flux, Mill's theory is a model to evaluate
    change in a society and a person, are they developing or stagnating,
    it's not about holding any set of beliefs, but it's about how one
    holds them, are they up to challenge, or scrutiny.

### Chapter 2 of *On Liberty*

-   Here Mill attempts to defend the open society, the describe
    principles about the conduct of the search for truth in a civilized
    community.
-   So he says on page 86: \> If the arguments of the present chapter
    are of any validity, there ought to exist the fullest liberty of
    professing and discussing, as a matter of ethical conviction, any
    doctrine, however immoral it may be considered.
-   The need to provide rational basis for beliefs, it is not a matter
    of tradition or custom.
-   Just because a belief is traditional does not make it valid or
    invalid, there is no inference either way.
-   Let's say this:
    1.  The need for rational justification for any belief.
        -   These cannot simply be held, they need to be justified
        -   It does not matter how a belief is acquired.
        -   What matters is how the belief is maintained by an
            individual.
        -   The *process* of justification.

    2.  The problems with avoiding the ideal of justification through
        any kind of inquiry, "infallibility"
        -   For example, on page 88, the problem of absolute certainty.
            \> To refuse a hearing to an opinion, because they are sure
            that it is false, is to assume that their certainty is the
            same thing as absolute certainty. All silencing of
            discussion is an assumption of infallibility.
        -   You can feel absolutely confident about going to win the
            lottery, and lose it. Certainty and any kind of feeling is
            unreliable and not useful.
        -   **Dan**: I am having a little bit of trouble with this as
            well.
        -   **Colby**: What's your objection?
        -   **Dan**: Based on this, he says that, I have a problem with
            the general point, that your not supposed to stop discussion
            because of this, that this implies that your infallible.
            Lets say for some reason, that I let a piece of facism come
            out. If I let it get out, I have reason to believe that if
            it does, people will believe it. So I decide to not let this
            piece of thinking come out. Lets say I'm a lawmaker, for
            some reason I can have the power to have it coming out at
            all, and if I do I have reasonable justification for
            allowing people to read it, etc. So basically, I have
            reasonable belief to say that I will stop a lot of people
            will not be Nazis, because I think there stupid.
        -   **Colby**: How do you know that people will become Nazis?
            Mill says you can not know that. Absolute certainty is not
            distinguishing from the truth.
        -   **Dan**: The point is this. If I belief that I'm right about
            believing in something. And I've come to the conclusion that
            Nazism is bad. It's not assuming that I'm infallible, it's
            just that I'm better qualified.
        -   **Colby**: Your fallibility extends to every belief you
            hold, including that one.
        -   **Dan**: This is that you don't have to say that I'm
            infallible, you just have to say that I'm better.
        -   **Colby**: For Mill, infallibility is global. Let me say
            more. One issue is this. What Mill means by infallibility is
            that you cannot isolate one belief from the entire net of
            beliefs.
        -   **Dan**: Not my point.
        -   **Colby**: Let me finish this. All of a person's beliefs are
            fallible, as well all the reasons justifying them are
            fallible.
        -   On page 88: \> ages are no more infallible than individuals;
            every age having held many opinions which subsequent ages
            have deemed not only false but absurd;
        -   You have the affects of custom, of blind reinforcement of
            beliefs that are thought to be true.
        -   Rememeber, you have the individual who reacts with society,
            and the open society is one which benefits its members and
            it benefits from them, bidirectional. \> Complete liberty of
            contradicting and disproving our opinion, is the very
            condition which justifies us in assuming its truth for
            purposes of action; and on no other terms can a being with
            human faculties have any rational assurance of being right.
        -   A true belief is going to be identified with a belief which
            has been tested.
        -   Think of it this way: The search for truth is a collective
            effort of rival beliefs and rival opinions and rival items
            claiming to be true. So that you need a marketplace or a
            public forum in which every belief is subject to scrutiny
            with no belief immunized for no reason whatsoever. If you
            don't know why you hold the opinions you do, then they are
            being held irrationally.

-   Let me put it like this: There are five different requirements that
    are in chapter 2 without being very explicit:
    1.  Knowing what you believe is true, self scrutiny, self knowledge.
    2.  Knowing why you believe it to be true, what grounds do you have?
        \> He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of
        that. His reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to
        refute them. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons
        on the opposite side; if he does not so much as know what they
        are, he has no ground for preferring either opinion.
    3.  What the opposing or rival beliefs are on the same issue.
        -   For instance, you may know why abortion is morally wrong,
            but you need to know why it might be morally right.
        -   It has nothing to do with your custom.

    4.  Knowing the strongest argument on both sides.
    5.  Provisionally accept whatever the strongest argument is.
        -   Reason is a procedural mechanism.

    6.  Be willing to revise your position based on all sides of the
        argument.

-   Hegel argued there are two kinds of circularity, negative and
    positive, if you want an interesting book, read Rockmore's *Hegel's
    Circular Epistemology*.
-   On page 102, \> No one can be a great thinker who does not
    recognise, that as a thinker it is his first duty to follow his
    intellect to whatever conclusions it may lead.
-   One of Mill's other major works of the time period is the need to
    give women equal moral and political status with men by giving them
    the right to vote, *On the Subjection of Women*
-   Half of the human race is denied individuality because of sexism.
-   This gives us the foundation for self development.
-   Diversity of opinions both express our distinct natures but express
    our process for truth seeking. Why?
    1.  The existing opinions might all be false;
    2.  There might be more to learn about them if they were true, to
        enlarge the fabric of our understanding.

-   We want to enlarge the range of possible candidates for truth.
-   It's wrong to silence an unorthodox opinion because even if it's
    wrong it might contain some true, some insight, something that is
    valuable of it, and so silencing will deprive of what this is, large
    or small.
-   You need to have not only rational belief, but you also need vital
    belief, a belief that hasn't become ossified into dead dogma, we
    need to revisit our beliefs in order to make them part of our living
    fabric.
-   The need for freedom of expression as a precondition to self
    development. This is because our faculties require cultivate, the
    mind is like a muscle, it needs to be exercised, and this is done
    through the examinations of reasons for and against opinions

Mills On Liberty
----------------

### Chapter I: Intro.

-   Need of protection against the magistrate and the non-legal tyranny
    of the majority. NOTE: the threat of mass-society to individual
    liberty\
-   Thesis: The sole permissible end for individual or collective
    interference with individual liberty of action is the avoidance of
    harm to others (other regarding actions). In¬† matters concerning
    only oneself, ones right is absolute (self-regarding actions).¬† Over
    oneself, ones body and mind, the individual is sovereign.¬† Hence,
    the following sacrosanct: absolute liberty of conscience, tastes,
    opinion & speech; limited liberty of pursuits and association (no
    harm to others clause).
-   Method of argument: utilitarian argument (that is, PU) applied to
    the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.

### Chapter II: Of the liberty of thought and discussion

> First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for
> aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our
> own infallibility. Secondly, though the silenced opinion be an error,
> it may, and very commonly does, contain a portion of truth; and since
> the general or prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never
> the whole truth, it is only by the collision of adverse opinions that
> the remainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied. Thirdly,
> even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole truth;
> unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and earnestly
> contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the
> manner of a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its
> rational grounds. And not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning of the
> doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and
> deprived of its vital effect on the character and conduct: the dogma
> becoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious for good, but
> cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of any real and
> heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience.

-   Mill attempts to prove his claim from the first chapter that
    opinions ought never to be suppressed. \> "Such prejudice, or
    oversight, when it [i.e. false belief] occurs, is altogether an
    evil; but it is one from which we cannot hope to be always exempt,
    and must be regarded as the price paid for an inestimable good."
-   Three types of claims: wholly false, partly true, and wholly true
-   These freedoms necessary for the well-being of humankind because:
    -   suppressed opinion might be true.
    -   even if partially true, the discovery of full truth is easier
        with an open discussion of it.
    -   even if the suppressed opinion totally false, its presence is
        needed to avoid true contrasting opinion be transformed in dogma
        without knowledge of supporting reasons.

-   limitations to these freedoms always advantageous to the majority or
    dominant view.
-   it's impossible to set bounds for temperate, informative,
    non-tendentious discussion. So, anything goes. However: limits in
    case of clear and present danger, e.g. corn-dealers are starvers of
    the poor! said to mob in front of corn-dealer house; fire! in
    crowded cinema
-   Mill spends a large portion of the chapter discussing implications
    of and objections to the policy of never suppressing opinions.
-   In doing so, Mill explains his opinion of Christian ethics, arguing
    that, while they are praiseworthy, they are incomplete on their own.
-   Therefore, Mill concludes that suppression of opinion based on
    belief in infallible doctrine is dangerous.
-   Among the other objections Mill answers, is the objection that the
    truth will necessarily survive persecution and that society need
    only teach the grounds for truth, not the objections to it.

### Chapter III: On individuality, as one of the elements of wellbeing

> It really is of importance, not only what men do, but also what manner
> of men they are that do it. Among the works of man, which human life
> is rightly employed in perfecting and beautifying, the first in
> importance surely is man himself. Supposing it were possible to get
> houses built, corn grown, battles fought, causes tried, and even
> churches erected and prayers said, by machinery‚Äîby automatons in human
> form‚Äîit would be a considerable loss to exchange for these automatons
> even the men and women who at present inhabit the more civilised parts
> of the world, and who assuredly are but starved specimens of what
> nature can and will produce. Human nature is not a machine to be built
> after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a
> tree, which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides,
> according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living
> thing.

-   Freedom of action is not as unrestricted as freedom of opinion
    because it is more likely than mere speech to harm others. However,
    since it's a manifestation of individuality, it should be protected
    because individuality is important both to individuals and to
    society
    1.  Individuality important to well-being of individual because
        -   A. plasticity argument
        -   human nature not like a machine, built after a fixed model,
            but like a tree developing through its own forces and
            responding to the demands of the environment. We are, in
            many respects, different from one another.
        -   such development is good because it brings out the best in
            us.
            -   NOTE: note Mill's optimism and his attack on calvinism
                and dark view of human nature.

        -   B. Pleasure/pain argument
        -   Sources of pleasure and pain different for different
        -   people.¬† Hence, unless people left free to pursue their
            different interests and ends, theyll miss out on happiness.

    2.  Individuality important to well-being of society because:
        -   genius and spur to change and improvement are maximized in
            an atmosphere valuing individuality and different thinking.
        -   danger of mass-society in which mediocrity produces
            oppressive custom: in this case, even mere eccentricity is a
            good.

### Chapter IV: of the limits to the authority of society over the individual.

-   Question: What are the limits to the sovereignty of individual over
    himself?
    -   Answer: Society may interfere with the part of the individuals
        life chiefly interesting society (other regarding actions); the
        individual is sovereign in that part chiefly interesting the
        individual (self-regarding actions).¬† Hence:
        -   One not allowed:
            -   to injure those interests of others which by law or
                tacit understanding are considered important.
            -   to avoid ones share of labor and sacrifice needed to
                defend society from injury and molestation.

        -   Apart from the above, ones freedom is complete because that
            is the¬† sphere of self-regarding actions.¬† There is no
            parity between the feeling of a person for his own opinion
            and that of one offended¬† by it. If we dont agree with ones
            behavior, we can avoid his company (without parading the
            avoidance), warn others, not offer him optional positions.\
            Examples: temperance laws; Sabbatical precepts; persecution
            of Mormons because of polygamy.

### Chapter V: Applications

1.  Cases in which liberty is unjustly denied because the actions
    involved are essentially self-regarding:
    -   restrictions on sale of poisons, opium, alcohol
        -   Rationale: these restrictions on liberty of buyer. However,
            it's permissible:
            -   to require registration
            -   to control drinking in drunkard not fullfilling
                obligations
            -   to compel idle to work if not fulfilling obligations

    -   Prohibition of actions dangerous for agent only.
    -   Rationale: these self-regarding actions. However, it's
        permissible to have warnings (Crossing of safe bridge example).
    -   NOTE: self-slavery impermissible because contradictory with idea
        of freedom, which doen't include the ‚Äúfreedom to alienate one‚Äôs
        freedom.‚Äù
    -   regulations about number of liquor shops.
    -   Rationale: no paternalism against any group. However, it's
        premissible to tax liquor because not a necessity.
    -   Requests public licences for practicing. However, certificates
        may be issued as advisory to the public.

2.  Cases in which freedom is wrongly invoked because the actions
    involved are other-regarding
    -   Family relations involving abuse.
    -   avoiding educating one‚Äôs children. However, home school ok, if
        reasonable state tests passed.
    -   Procreating without any means to support progeny.

3.  Objections to state interference even when liberty not at stake:
    -   individual concerned do often better job than state.
    -   even when state would do slightly better, it‚Äôs educational and
        conducive to development that individuals do it: e.g. jury
        trial, philanthropic and industrial voluntary associations.
        Moreover, greater experimentation within society.
    -   avoids the evil of giving added power to the state.
    -   Rationale: Where state has massive control, liberty exists in
        name only.
    -   General rule: greatest possible decentralization of power
        consistent with efficiency and greatest possible centralization
        of information and diffusion from the center.

### Mill on the Moral Right to Free Expression of Thought by J.P. Day

1.  That there ought to be an absolute freedom and sentiment on all
    subjections.
2.  That there ought to be an absolute liberty of **expression** and
    publishing opinions.
    -   This is to be decisively rejected for two reasons:.
        1.  There are no indefeasible moral rights.
        2.  There are exceptions to the claim (as even Mill admits).

    -   Mill has three reasons for this:
        2.  That there ought to be an absolute duty to
            **self-development**, which entails a corresponding absolute
            moral right and duty to self-expression.
        3.  The third reason for Mill's strange view of the moral right
            to free expression is his belief in the absolute value of
            liberty, which of course includes liberty of expression.
            Mill asserts that "all restraint, *qua restraint*, is an
            evil."

> It is disconcerting to find justification for the excesses of tabloid
> journalism in the famous essay of the great champion of Liberty. But
> that sad conclusion is inescapable.

-   (I) Mill's principle of individual liberty: "that the only purpose
        for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a
        civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to
        others."

    -   a "secondary principle" of morality that is grounded in the
        first principle of morality

-   (II) Mill's principle of the liberty of expression: "a speaker or a
        writer has an absolute moral right to absolute freedom of
        expression."

-   Mill tells us twice that his chief aim in On Liberty is to assert
    and defend principle (I)
-   Mill discusses two cases of instigation:
    1.  saying or writing that tyrants ought to be assassinated, and
    2.  saying ‚Äúcorn-dealers are starvers of the poor‚Äù to an excited mob
        assembled before the house of a corn-dealer

### Mill, Indecency, and the Liberty Principle by Jonathan Wolff

1.  The interpretation of the liberty principle
    -   If the way we interpret Mill's liberty principle naively and
        simply that the only condition which states can intervene is to
        prevent the harm to others, then to evaluate the truth or
        falsity we must look at applications.
    -   Mill believes freedom of thought it without bound.

> There are many acts which, being directly injurious only to agents
> themselves, ought not be legally interdicted, but which, if done
> publicly, are a violation of good manners, and coming thus within the
> category of offenses against other, may rightly be prohibited. Of this
> kind are offenses against decency; on which it is unnecessary to
> dwell, the rather as they are only connected indirectly with our
> subject, the objection to publicity being equally strong in the case
> of many actions not in themselves condemnable, nor supposed to be.

-   This is "coy and confusing"
-   What type of acts could these be?
    1.  Masturbation
    2.  Self-harm
