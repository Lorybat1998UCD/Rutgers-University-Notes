# Aristotle Notes 

## January 24th, 2013 - Lecture

- The class will deal mostly with perception. This affects four areas:
	1. Epistemology and philosophy of science
		* Lets say that I make the judgement that there are colored things in front of me.
		* On what grounds am I warranted in making this perceptual judgement?
	2. Psychology
		* You can study perception as one of the modes of our psychological state.
	3. Biology
		* There's a broader question of what type of role does perception play in physical beings.
		* Aristotle is not only a philosopher but a natural scientist. 
		* There is no conflict between natural and social science for Aristotle.
	4. Ethics and political philosophy
		* Aristotle assigns a very import role to perception to identify some very important part of what is needed for correct moral judgement.
- The main text for Aristotle and epistemology will be *Posterior Analytics*

### Generation of Animals

> In all this Nature acts like an intelligent workman. For to the essence of plants belongs no other function or business than the production of seed; since, then, this is brought about by the union of male and female, Nature has mixed these and set them together in plants, so that the sexes are not divided in them. Plants, however, have been investigated elsewhere. But the function of the animal is not only to generate (which is common to all living things), but they all of them participate also in a kind of knowledge, some more and some less, and some very little indeed. For they have sense-perception, and this is a kind of knowledge.

- Aristotle's word for knowledge is *gnosis*.

> (If we consider the value of this we find that it is of great importance compared with the class of lifeless objects, but of little compared with the use of the intellect. For against the latter the mere participation in touch and taste seems to be practically nothing.)

- Aristotle is comparing two kinds of knowledge, he is using a Greek word which means "intellectual knowledge."
- Taste and touch do not use reason or the intellect.
- There are various words that Aristotle uses for reason and intellect.
- Some of these words are ambigious between the state of intellect and the abiblity to reason.
- We also uses the word *phronesis*.
- We start with this claim about perception, and he makes this claim in a number of places.
- He will want to defend it.
- Philosophically surprising to say perception is a kind of knowledge
	+ You may think we make "perceptual mistakes."
	+ We mispercieve all the time - optical illusions, mirages.
	+ How is perception knowledge if we mispercieve.
	+ Plato refers to this in Theatetus.
		* Claim: perception is identical with knowledge.
		* The objection is he raises is misperception.
	+ Is perception enough for knowledge?
- The Greek word *aisthesis* is an ambiguous term, it can be a capacity or an activity - a "success term."
- Aristotle means this more as "Percieving is a kind of knowing."
- We have Plato saying that perception is no kind of knowledge.
	+ Plato give some arguments for this.
	+ Perception cannot reach truth because perception cannot get at "what is."

### On Interpretation

> As there are in the mind thoughts which do not involve truth or falsity,
> and also those which must be either true or false, so it is in speech.
> For truth and falsity imply combination and separation. Nouns and
> verbs, provided nothing is added, are like thoughts without combination
> or separation; 'man' and 'white', as isolated terms, are not yet either
> true or false. In proof of this, consider the word 'goat-stag.' It
> has significance, but there is no truth or falsity about it, unless
> 'is' or 'is not' is added, either in the present or in some other
> tense. 

### De Anima

> There are two distinctive peculiarities by reference to which we characterize the soul (1) local movement and (2) thinking, discriminating, and perceiving. Thinking both speculative and practical is regarded as akin to a form of perceiving; for in the one as well as the other the soul discriminates and is cognizant of something which is. Indeed the ancients go so far as to identify thinking and perceiving; e.g. Empedocles says 'For 'tis in respect of what is present that man's wit is increased', and again 'Whence it befalls them from time to time to think diverse thoughts', and Homer's phrase 'For suchlike is man's mind' means the same. 

> They all look upon thinking as a bodily process like perceiving, and hold that like is known as well as perceived by like, as I explained at the beginning of our discussion.

- They have this arguement for linking percieving with knowing, Empedocles.
- Because in both cases "like is known by like."
- What exactly does this have to do with anything?

### Metaphysics

> And in general it is because these thinkers suppose knowledge to be sensation, and this to be a physical alteration, that they say that what appears to our senses must be true; for it is for these reasons that both Empedocles and Democritus and, one may almost say, all the others have fallen victims to opinions of this sort. For Empedocles says that when men change their condition they change their knowledge.

- Knowledge (gnosis) split into two:
	1. Perception
	2. Intellection/intelligent

### On Dreams
	
> We must, in the next place, investigate the subject of the dream, and first inquire to which of the faculties of the soul it presents itself, i.e. whether the affection is one which pertains to the faculty of intelligence or to that of sense-perception; for these are the only faculties within us by which we acquire knowledge. 

- Do we get knowledge in dreams?
- People used to think that you'd predict the future in dreams.
- We get the strong claim that the list above is the only source of knowledge.
- Strongly anti-Platonic
	- Plato argues that perception cannot be a source of knowledge because it cannot deliver it in propositional form.
	- Perception can only deliver "red" and "card" and "here now" - they are restricted in what they can provide you with.

### Nicomachean Ethics

- Here are the kinds of things you get in intellectual learning, of the most advanced sort.
- States of excellence.
- Chapter 3, plays an interesting role.
- Episteme can mean two things:
	1. A science
		+ Principles 
		+ Theorems (*archai*)
	2. Knowledge
- All scientific knowledge is thought to be capable of being taught, and its object being learnt.
- All teaching starts from what is already known.
- It's sometimes perceived through induction, and sometimes through deduction.
	+ First principles are taught by induction.
	+ And deduction precedes from universals.
- If we get the knowledge of principles from deduction and knowledge of something from inducition form particulars, where do we get knowledge of particulkars from?
