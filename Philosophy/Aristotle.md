----------------------------

-   The class will deal mostly with perception. This affects four areas:
    1.  Epistemology and philosophy of science
        -   Lets say that I make the judgement that there are colored
            things in front of me.
        -   On what grounds am I warranted in making this perceptual
            judgement?

    2.  Psychology
        -   You can study perception as one of the modes of our
            psychological state.

    3.  Biology
        -   There's a broader question of what type of role does
            perception play in physical beings.
        -   Aristotle is not only a philosopher but a natural scientist.
        -   There is no conflict between natural and social science for
            Aristotle.

    4.  Ethics and political philosophy
        -   Aristotle assigns a very import role to perception to
            identify some very important part of what is needed for
            correct moral judgement.

-   The main text for Aristotle and epistemology will be *Posterior
    Analytics*

### Generation of Animals

> In all this Nature acts like an intelligent workman. For to the
> essence of plants belongs no other function or business than the
> production of seed; since, then, this is brought about by the union of
> male and female, Nature has mixed these and set them together in
> plants, so that the sexes are not divided in them. Plants, however,
> have been investigated elsewhere. But the function of the animal is
> not only to generate (which is common to all living things), but they
> all of them participate also in a kind of knowledge, some more and
> some less, and some very little indeed. For they have
> sense-perception, and this is a kind of knowledge.

-   Aristotle's word for knowledge is *gnosis*.

> (If we consider the value of this we find that it is of great
> importance compared with the class of lifeless objects, but of little
> compared with the use of the intellect. For against the latter the
> mere participation in touch and taste seems to be practically
> nothing.)

-   Aristotle is comparing two kinds of knowledge, he is using a Greek
    word which means "intellectual knowledge."
-   Taste and touch do not use reason or the intellect.
-   There are various words that Aristotle uses for reason and
    intellect.
-   Some of these words are ambigious between the state of intellect and
    the abiblity to reason.
-   We also uses the word *phronesis*.
-   We start with this claim about perception, and he makes this claim
    in a number of places.
-   He will want to defend it.
-   Philosophically surprising to say perception is a kind of knowledge
    -   You may think we make "perceptual mistakes."
    -   We mispercieve all the time - optical illusions, mirages.
    -   How is perception knowledge if we mispercieve.
    -   Plato refers to this in Theatetus.
        -   Claim: perception is identical with knowledge.
        -   The objection is he raises is misperception.

    -   Is perception enough for knowledge?

-   The Greek word *aisthesis* is an ambiguous term, it can be a
    capacity or an activity - a "success term."
-   Aristotle means this more as "Percieving is a kind of knowing."
-   We have Plato saying that perception is no kind of knowledge.
    -   Plato give some arguments for this.
    -   Perception cannot reach truth because perception cannot get at
        "what is."

### On Interpretation

> As there are in the mind thoughts which do not involve truth or
> falsity, and also those which must be either true or false, so it is
> in speech. For truth and falsity imply combination and separation.
> Nouns and verbs, provided nothing is added, are like thoughts without
> combination or separation; 'man' and 'white', as isolated terms, are
> not yet either true or false. In proof of this, consider the word
> 'goat-stag.' It has significance, but there is no truth or falsity
> about it, unless 'is' or 'is not' is added, either in the present or
> in some other tense.

### De Anima

> There are two distinctive peculiarities by reference to which we
> characterize the soul (1) local movement and (2) thinking,
> discriminating, and perceiving. Thinking both speculative and
> practical is regarded as akin to a form of perceiving; for in the one
> as well as the other the soul discriminates and is cognizant of
> something which is. Indeed the ancients go so far as to identify
> thinking and perceiving; e.g. Empedocles says 'For 'tis in respect of
> what is present that man's wit is increased', and again 'Whence it
> befalls them from time to time to think diverse thoughts', and Homer's
> phrase 'For suchlike is man's mind' means the same.

> They all look upon thinking as a bodily process like perceiving, and
> hold that like is known as well as perceived by like, as I explained
> at the beginning of our discussion.

-   They have this arguement for linking percieving with knowing,
    Empedocles.
-   Because in both cases "like is known by like."
-   What exactly does this have to do with anything?

### Metaphysics

> And in general it is because these thinkers suppose knowledge to be
> sensation, and this to be a physical alteration, that they say that
> what appears to our senses must be true; for it is for these reasons
> that both Empedocles and Democritus and, one may almost say, all the
> others have fallen victims to opinions of this sort. For Empedocles
> says that when men change their condition they change their knowledge.

-   Knowledge (gnosis) split into two:
    1.  Perception
    2.  Intellection/intelligent

### On Dreams

> We must, in the next place, investigate the subject of the dream, and
> first inquire to which of the faculties of the soul it presents
> itself, i.e. whether the affection is one which pertains to the
> faculty of intelligence or to that of sense-perception; for these are
> the only faculties within us by which we acquire knowledge.

-   Do we get knowledge in dreams?
-   People used to think that you'd predict the future in dreams.
-   We get the strong claim that the list above is the only source of
    knowledge.
-   Strongly anti-Platonic
    -   Plato argues that perception cannot be a source of knowledge
        because it cannot deliver it in propositional form.
    -   Perception can only deliver "red" and "card" and "here now" -
        they are restricted in what they can provide you with.

### Nicomachean Ethics

-   Here are the kinds of things you get in intellectual learning, of
    the most advanced sort.
-   States of excellence.
-   Chapter 3, plays an interesting role.
-   Episteme can mean two things:
    1.  A science
        -   Principles
        -   Theorems (*archai*)

    2.  Knowledge

-   All scientific knowledge is thought to be capable of being taught,
    and its object being learnt.
-   All teaching starts from what is already known.
-   It's sometimes perceived through induction, and sometimes through
    deduction.
    -   First principles are taught by induction.
    -   And deduction precedes from universals.

-   If we get the knowledge of principles from deduction and knowledge
    of something from inducition form particulars, where do we get
    knowledge of particulkars from?

Short paper assignment
----------------------

-   Describe in detail Aristotle's epistomological program in the
    "Posterior Analytics."
    -   With special attention to I 1-3, 18, 31 and II 19.

-   In your description, describe and evaluate the account of this
    offered by Freda and Bronstein.

### Posterior Analytics

-   **First principles**: there is nothing prior to them from which they
    can be derived. They are:
    -   **True**
        -   What is necessary
        -   Cannot be otherwise

    -   **Primary** (primitive)
        -   If and only if there is no prior principle from which it can
            be derived

    -   **Immediate** (unmediated)
        -   If and only if there is no middle term to explain their
            connection

    -   **Better known** (than what we derive from them)
    -   **Prior** (to what we derive from them)
        -   There are two senses
            1.  In itself, by nature, *further* from perception
            2.  To us, *closer* to perception

    -   **Explanatory** (of what we derive from them)

-   Aristotle insists on indemonstrable first principles because
    otherwise one is forced into
    -   infinitely long explanations
        -   No proof is infinitely long.

    -   circular reasoning
        -   Impossible because then something will have to be prior to
            and more familiar than itself, which is impossible.

    -   skepticism

> We reply that not all knowledge is demonstrative, and in fact
> knowledge of the immediate premises is indemonstrable. Indeed, it is
> evident that this must be so.

-   **Demonstration**:
    -   Deriving a conclusion syllogistically from more basic truths
        -   Syllogistically: an instance of a form of reasoning in which
            a conclusion is drawn (whether validly or not) from two
            given or assumed propositions (premises), each of which
            shares a term with the conclusion, and shares a common or
            middle term not present in the conclusion

    -   Explanation is a mirror-image of demonstration. To explain why
        it is the case that p is to deduce p from more basic principles.
    -   A syllogism that is necessary

#### Book I

##### Chapter 1

-   Barnes
    -   All teaching/learning comes from **preexisting knowledge**.
        -   All math and arts is acquired this way.
        -   Deductive arguments use what we already know
            -   Assumes what we presume to grasp

        -   Inductive arguments use what we already know
            -   Proves something universal from particular cases

    -   There are two ways in which we already have knowledge
        1.  Some things we must already believe are.
        2.  Of others we must grasp what the items spoken about are

    -   It is possible to acquire knowledge of some items, and get
        knowledge of others are the very same time.
        -   Moving from the universal you know to the particular
        -   You already knew that a triangle's angles sum to two right
            triangles.
        -   You got to know that the figure in the semicircle was a
            triangle at the same time as you were being led to the
            conclusion.

-   Freeland
    -   All teaching and learning result from previous cognition.
        1.  We presuppose that something is (the fact); or
        2.  We comprehend what it is (the reasoned fact).

    -   Solution to **Meno's Paradox**: We know in one way what we are
        learning, while being ignorant in another way.

##### Chapter 2

-   Barnes
    -   We think we understand something in and of itself when we
        understand the explanation for something and think that it could
        not be otherwise.
        -   It is plain to understand something of this sort.

    -   We know things through **demonstration**
        -   A demonstration is a scientific deduction
            -   Where scientific means "possesing by which we understand
                something."

    -   A demonstrative understanding goes from those things that are
        true, primitive, and familiar to the conclusions.
        -   There can be a deduction even without these conditions, but
            there can't be a demonstration.

    -   They must be true because you can't understand that which isn't
        the case.
        -   Must proceed from items that are primitive and
            indemonstrable.

    -   Things are prior and more familiar in two ways:
        1.  It is not the same to be prior to us and prior to us in
            nature.
        2.  To be more familiar and more familiar to us. (?)

    -   Prior and more familiar to us are items closer to us in
        perception.
    -   What is most universal is furthest away to us in perception.
        -   Particulars are nearest.

    -   To proceed from primitives is to proceed from what is
        appropriate.
        -   The principle of a demonstration is the immediate
            proposition.
        -   A proposition is immediate if it follows from no other.
        -   A proposition is one part of a contradictory pair.

-   Freeland
    -   **Demonstration**: a deduction expressing knowledge.
        -   Apodeixis = syllogismos epistemonikos

    -   Premises of a demonstration must be
        -   **Absolute features**: true, primary, immediate,
        -   **Relative features**: better known than (more familiar,
            *gnorimoteron*), prior to, and explanatory of the
            conclusion. "better known" and "prior" have two senses: 1.
            closer to us, or clearer through sense-perception; 2.
            further from us, closer to the truth (closer to the
            universal)

    -   Key terms
        -   **proposition** (*protasis*, premise): one part of a
            contradictory pair
        -   **posit** (thesis): something that cannot be proved; need
            not be grasped by anyone who is to learn
        -   **axiom** (axiom): ditto, but MUST be grasped by anyone who
            is to learn
        -   **supposition** (hypothesis): assumes something does or does
            not exist
        -   **definition** (*horismos*): does not assume something is (a
            kind of thesis, not a hypothesis)

##### Chapter 3

-   Freeland
    -   It is not true that all things that are known are known by
        demonstration.
    -   To insist on this would result in one of two unacceptable
        consequences:
        1.  Either there will be an infinite regress, since the
            primitives will have to be demonstrated, on and on ad
            infinitum; or
        2.  There will be circular demonstrations. (Aristotle thinks
            some circular or reciprocal demonstrations are possible,
            involving what he calls "counterpredicables," but that these
            will be very limited.)

##### Chapter 6

-   Every demonstrative science is concerned with three things:
    1.  the kind (genos): things it posits to exist;
    2.  the common axioms: primitives from which demonstration proceeds;
    3.  attributes (pathe): things that will hold "in themselves" of the
        kind; we assume what each means (and prove that it is)

-   More on axioms, postulates, etc.:
    1.  A provable but unproved assumption is a postulate;
    2.  When accepted by the person, this becomes a hypothesis;
    3.  Hypotheses are propositions (they assert existence or
        non-existence); definitions are not;
    4.  Postulates and hypotheses are universal or particular,
        definitions are neither.

##### Chapter 18

-   If explanations do not arrive at what is atomic,
    -   If there is not one middle term but several,
        -   Then the explanations too are several.

    -   The middle term that is explanatory of the particulars is the
        one that is nearest to the to that which it is explanotory for
        (universal or particular).
    -   Example:
        1.  C is explanatory for D of B's holding of it.
        2.  So C is explanotory of A for D.
        3.  B is explanotory of A for C
        4.  B is explanotory of A for itself.

##### Chapter 31

##### Synopsis

-   All knowledge depends on pre-existent knowledge of the learner
    -   Some things the learner does not need to know in advance
    -   In a sense he knows the conclusion in advance.

-   Understanding requires knowledge of the explanation
    -   Demonstrative knowledge comes from principles that are:
        -   True
        -   Primitive
        -   Immediate
        -   Prior to the conclusion
        -   More familiar than the conclusion
        -   Explanatory of the conclusion

    -   The principles must be better known than the conclusion
    -   This account of understanding threatens to regress to
        -   Skepticism
        -   Circular reasoning

    -   What is understood must follow from necessary principles

-   Principles are unprovable

#### Book II

##### Chapter 19

-   Ross
    -   Demonstrative science is impossible without knowledge of first
        principles. Which raises two questions:
        1.  Whether these are objects of science, or of some other
            faculty.
        2.  Whether such faculty comes into being or is present
            without being recognized.
    
    -   It would be strange if we had knowledge better than 
        demonstration without knowing it.
    
    -   Such a faculty, all animals have.
        -   An innate faculty of discernment, **perception**.
        -   For some animals, the knowledge does not persist.
        -   But for others, there is the power of **retention**.
        
    -   Thus from perceptions arises **memory**.
        -   Repeated memory of the same things makes **experience**.
        -   When the whole universal has come to be in soul through
            experience, comes the one distinct from many and identical
            in all instance
            -   The beginning of art and science.
            
    -   Thus these states of knowledge are neither innate, nor come from
        more cognitive states of the mind, but from **perception**.
    -   Induction through perception implants the universal in us.

###### Commentary

-   We now have to consider how first principles come to be known and
    what faculties know them.
-   The first principles are more knowable than the conclusions that
    follow from them.
    -   It is not from science that we grasp the first principles.
    -   It is from intuitive reasons that we do.
    -   Demonstration cannot be the proof of demonstration.
        -   Therefore, science cannot be the proof of science.
        
    -   **Intuitive reason** is the only necessarily true state other than 
        science.
        -   Yet we cannot acquire it equally without pre-existing
            knowledge.
        -   So we can neither already have it or acquire it.
        -   It follows that it must start with some **faculty**.
