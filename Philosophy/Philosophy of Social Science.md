# Philosophy of Social Science <small>with Professor Mark Colby</small>

## February 22nd, 2013 - Lecture

- Things to keep in mind in MacIntyre's papers, this is just to help with reading:
	1. What is being criticized in another philosopher (negative, to show what someone got wrong) vs.
	2. What is being defended (positive views, what the author is also discussing)
		1. Author's own views
			* Which he clearly holds
		2. Author's discussion of possible objections
		3. His replies to objections
- Necessary conditions for understanding any human society, this is the basic question MacIntyre is addressing, there are two areas:
	1. Which there are necesarry, sufficient,
		* Empirical (natural regularities)
		* Linguistic
			1. Concepts of same, different
			2. Concepts found in the institutions (conceptual schemes)
			3. "way of life" of the society
	2. MacIntyre
		* What else is needed?
		* Status of Western logic?
- The understanding of any space and time would come under empirical understanding.
- There is a disctiontion between behavior and action
	+ Where are behavior is something like sexuality
	+ And where the behavior is polygny, polyandry, etc.
	+ Actions involve:
		* launguage, 
		* intent, 
		* standards, 
		* appropriate conduct, 
		* violations, 
		* conciousness, 
		* awareness, 
		* mastery of language
	+ Whereas behavior is "purely determinstic", what produces hunger.
		* We can still override them with the awareness of ourselves.
		* We can choose to forgo food, voluntarily fast
	+ Behiviors involve more causal explanations
	+ Actions involve more understanding
- Some of the issues involved, listed by severity.
	+ **Relativism**: You can have conceptual relativism. That the stock of concepts that a society has
	are not determined by the human body. So you have a trememdous variety or conceptual
	ideas and languages. Each language has its own "stock" or set of concepts.
		* Conceptual: This one is harmless.
		* Epistemic: This one is serious. About the proper standard for evaluating
		assertions. This is more problematic because in logic and epistomology since
		the time of the Greeks, one of our concerns has been to identify different
		possible standards of good reasoning. Standards of appeal to common sense,
		which we think as philosophers is too low a standard. What we want are higher
		more rigourous standards of foundationalism, self-evidence.
		* Logical 
		* Linguistic
		* Alethic relativism: That truths can very. What's true at one time can be false
		at another time.
	+ Universalism
	+ Absolutism
