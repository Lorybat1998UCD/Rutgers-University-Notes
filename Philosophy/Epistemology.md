September 4th, 2013 <small>The Gettier Problem</small>
------------------------------------------------------

> What's Gettier's main point?

-   JTB is not complete because there are cases where JTB isn't knowledge.
    -   JTB is not sufficient for knowledge.
    
-   What he's after is, ... how does he argue for it?
    -   One strategy he is uses is describing cases where you have
        justification and belief and (by accident) truth.
        >   Yeah, Jones/Smith has a JTB, but he does not have
        >   knowledge.
        
-   Two claims about justification:
>   1.   **The Closure Principle**
>        -   What does it mean for a set of objects to be closed?
>        -   Every member of the set is related to every other member?
>       
>   2.  **The K-thesis**
>       1.  Kp $\to$ KKP
>       2.  Kp $\to$ KKK ... Kp

-   To know that `p` is to know everything about the concepts of `p`.
    -   To know that `Kp` you probably need to have the concepts of `K`, "knowledge."
    -   Therefore, if you don't know about knowing you can't know (?).
    
-   Look at the simple justification closure principle.
    -   Counterexamples?

>   **The Standard View**, that knowledge is justified true belief
>   plus something else. JTB+

-   **Internalists** argue that a feature of belief in virtue
    of which it is justified must, in some sense, be internal
    to the person that holds it.
    -   **Externalists** deny this.
    
-   **Reliabalists** think that justification comes from reliable
    belief-forming processes, reliably leading to truth.
-   Goldman rejected justification in 'A Causal Theory of Knowing'.
    -   He has said little in writing about this.

September 9th, 2013 <small>1st Meeting on Kornblith</small>
-----------------------------------------------------------

-   Descartes thinks that knowledge needs to be indubitable. 
-   Moore says "he knows that he has a hand," and so if any theory
	attests he doesn't, it's a bad theory.
	-   It's because he knows that he has a hand more than he knows your
		theory of knowledge.

-   You can tether a belief to truth with justification.
	-   Gettier said this wasn't good enough because you can have a justified
		true belief that isn't knowledge.
		-   Gettier cases do not entail the proposition which is false.

-   Here are two ways of talking about justification.
	-   Defeasiblility theory.
	-   Reliabalism.

-   There are two ways of solving Gettier.
	-   Ramping up evidence.
	-   Add a causal condition.
	-   Neither challenge justification.

-   Kornblith shows that justification isn't a necessary condition of 
	knowledge, his formulation.
-   Read carefully footnote 24.

September 11th, 2013 <small>2nd Meeting on Kornblith</small>
------------------------------------------------------------

-   Starting with AJ Ayer and Alvin Goldman, what tied truth to
    belief was reliable process.
    -   You might offer as reasons for belief an absolutely terrible
        reason.
        -   You might still know it if the belief was formed by
            a reliable process.
    
    -   You might provide fallacious reasoning, but if the all
        the processes you used reliably produce truth, then
        you know.
    -   Here's a case where the traditions will come apart:
        -   Think of the gypsie fortune teller who can predict
            the winner of the horse race.
        -   And they can predict the next one. And the next one.
            And over and over again.
        -   They don't know that they can get it right, but they
            believe it.
        -   They think knowledge is a property that many other
            animals have.
        -   Knowledge is a representational state.
        -   The gypsie fortune-teller knows because the representation                
        -   Does that mean our epistemic evaluation of the fortune-teller
            and the horse-race-scientist with rational reasons has to be the same?
            Not better?

-   Supervinience is when a set of properties *A* supervenes on a set *B*
    if and only if a change in the set of *A* properties implies a change in 
    the set of *B* properties.
-   Types of justification
    -   Doxastic justification is the belief state of justification actualized.
        -   This is what reliabilists are interested in.
        
    -   Propositional justification is the belief state of justification potentially.

-   Arguements on paper or dialetical arguments
    -   Public (community)
        -   Epistemic communities
        -   Contextualism
        
    -   Private
        -   Cartesian
        -   Foley

-   Argument:
	1.  There are only *x* levels of justification.
	2.  None of the *x* levels of justification are necessary for knowledge.
	3.  Therefore, justification is not necessary for knowledge.

-   There are two forms of justification for Kornblith:
	1.  Objective.
	2.  Subjective, of which there are:
		1.  Public, of where there are:
			1.  Contextualist
			2.  Equal?

		2.  Private

-   Galileo had knowledge but did not satisfy the requirements of the community.
	-   Your community can have totally kooky reasons for believing what they do.
	-   So you can have knowledge without satisfying their requirements.

-   The contextualist account of justification.
	-   It's that the standards for justification vary based on context.
	-   Suppose I say, along with Keith DeRose and Stewart Cohen, has this example:
		-   Consider a case *A* where a husband and wife are driving their car and the
			husband said, "I'd like to deposit this cheque in the bank."
		-   "How is the bank open?"
		-   "It was open last Saturday, and I think I remember seeing a sign."
		-   The person knew, therefore? We count this as knowledge.
		-   Now suppose the same case, but Klein is the person who has to deposit
			the cheque and it is absolutely crucial that Klein get it in, otherwise
			Klein will lose his house, money, etc.
		-   It's important to see what contextualists mean, *S* **knows** that *p*.
			-   "Know" is **attributor relative**, where it is like "here", "now",
				"I", "we."
			-   Attributor relative something reflexive â€¦

	-   Suppose Klein has very high standards, close to the Cartesian, and he says
		that you don't know unless you can eliminate all standards for doubt.
		-   Hume says the only way to avoid doubts, ignore the doubts of philosophers.

-   Closure where *h* = "I have a hand."
	1.  If *S* knows that *h*, then *S* knows that there is no evil genius making
		*S* falsely believe that *h*.
		-   I disagree, because it is possible that *S* can know that *h* **and**
			*S* can falsely believe *h*. How? Because if the evil genius made
			*S* believe that *h* and *h* were actually true, it would be an
			instance of falsely believing despite being true. How? Because
			the belief that *h* would violate the norms of believing.
		-   I think this argument may be abusing "believing falsely" by
			making it seem like the only way to do that is to believe something
			that is false. I think it's confusing because of perspective.
			Replace "belief" with "know", perhaps?
		-   Yes. It is not necessarily true that if *S* knows that *h*, then
			*S* doesn't falsely believe, because what the consequent should be
			is falsely *know* that *h*.
	2.  *S* doesn't know that there is not an evil genius.
		-   This means you have to be able to defeat all other cases.
	3.  Therefore, *S* doesn't know that *h*.

September 18th, 2013 <small>1st Meeting on Klein</small>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Some background

-   What most people think Gettier showed was that JTB was not
	*sufficient* for knowledge, not that they were not *necessary*.
	-   A lot of people thought that this may mean there is another
		condition, and the first attempt was **evidentialism**.
	-   The way that epistemologists initially attempted to solve this
		way by beefing up the justification condition.
	-   The recipe is find a false belief your justified in, find a
		true proposition that it entails, using closure.
		-   This belief will be true and justified which you believe
			on the basis of the deduction from a false justified belief.

-   Clark grants that JTB is not sufficient, and the way that he solves
	the Gettier problem is by saying the proposition that you use
	as evidence must be a JTB for you.
	-   If you get to the evidence or belief by chains of inference,
		they must all be true.
	-   It must be **fully-grounded**, if there is something false
		in there, it will be "lucky break" that you had a JTB.
	-   This is the first evidentialist approach.

### Evidentialism

-   **Disjunctive normal form**: $\lbrace a, b, c, d ... x \rbrace$:

	$$\exists x F(x) \equiv F(a) \lor F(b) \lor F(c) \lor ... $$  

-   Michael Clark came up with a case where you have justified,
	true, belief that whose basis is good and you *still* do not
	have knowledge.
	-   Klein comes to believe that Ben owns a Ford.
	-   As it turns out, Ben stole the Ford.
	-   He has a valid-looking title, and there's testimony
		that he bought it, etc.
	-   Klein comes to believe that someone in the class owns
		a Ford on the basis that Ben owns a Ford.
	-   As it turns out, someone does own a Ford in the class,
		but clearly not Ben.
	-   Imagine that Klein is epistemically careful, a careful
		reasoner. He notes that it's more likely that someone
		owns a Ford, and that the belief is less likely to be wrong,
		less risky.
		-   This clever reasoner did not make use of any false belief.

-   Consider another case: Klein has good evidence that Ben and Sherri
	own a Ford. Ben does not, Sherri does. Klein believes on these grounds
	that "someone owns a Ford."
	-   This is **epistemically overdetermined**, having two ways to get
		to the same belief, one false, one true, and still knowledge.

-   You can *always* fix a theory which is supposedly defeated by a counterexample
	by just ad-hoc ruling out the counter-example. But it's just that, it's *ad-hoc*.
	-   So evidentialism was supposed to not work (for now).

### Defeasibility

-   Many people think that **defeasibility theory** is part of
	the evidentialist tradition.
	-   The expression "defeasibility" comes from ethics.

-   Say *E* is the set of all evidence, for and against, a proposition *p*.
-   *e* is the set of evidence which justifies *S* in believing *p*. Notation:
	$$e J_S p$$

-   A good definition takes the cases where almost it's almost
	universally thought someone has knowledge and validates it,
	where it's almost universally thought someone doesn't and
	validates it, and where it's almost universally vague and
	clarifies it and why it's vague.

### Reliablism

-   There can be misleading evidence, so defeasibility eliminates
	too much.
	-   The simple defensibility theory isn't good, that, looks
		too strong.
	-   Many people thought that defeasibility didn't work.
	-   There was an alternatively available, which fit really
		nicely with naturalized epistemology.

-   Some people think that if you want to know what knowledge is,
	you shouldn't sit in your EZ chair and thinking about.
	-   Just like if you want to figure out what gold is, you
		go study gold things.
	-   If you want to study knowledge, go become a cognitive 
		scientist or psychologist.
	-   Knowledge is the end of a process, *go and study the process*!

-   The first shot was Alvin Goldman's paper, 'A Causal Theory of Knowledge.'
	-   Knowledge happens in the brain, in the mind.
	-   Knowledge, therefore, has a certain causal genealogy.
	-   The object has to be in the causal history of the belief.
	-   Suppose I look outside the window and I believe there will be
		rain in ten minutes. That belief cannot be caused by the rain in the
		ten minutes because the causal chain isn't temporally there yet.

-   Sometimes this is called internalist, where evidentialists and defeasibility theorists
	are called externalists.
-   Barn facade case:
	-   Supose you're going through phony barn country.
	-   A hurricane has come through upper Vermont, but people
		come for the barns.
	-   The tourist agency think that this will destroy the industry,
		so they put up facades.
	-   You're going through the country, and you see the *1* real barn.
	-   The barn is appropriately caused, it's justified true belief, but
		the intuition is that it is not knowledge.
