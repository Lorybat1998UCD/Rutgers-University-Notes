September 4th, 2013 <small>The Gettier Problem</small>
------------------------------------------------------

> What's Gettier's main point?

-   JTB is not complete because there are cases where JTB isn't knowledge.
    -   JTB is not sufficient for knowledge.
    
-   What he's after is, ... how does he argue for it?
    -   One strategy he is uses is describing cases where you have
        justification and belief and (by accident) truth.
        >   Yeah, Jones/Smith has a JTB, but he does not have
        >   knowledge.
        
-   Two claims about justification:
>   1.   **The Closure Principle**
>        -   What does it mean for a set of objects to be closed?
>        -   Every member of the set is related to every other member?
>       
>   2.  **The K-thesis**
>       1.  Kp $\to$ KKP
>       2.  Kp $\to$ KKK ... Kp

-   To know that `p` is to know everything about the concepts of `p`.
    -   To know that `Kp` you probably need to have the concepts of `K`, "knowledge."
    -   Therefore, if you don't know about knowing you can't know (?).
    
-   Look at the simple justification closure principle.
    -   Counterexamples?

>   **The Standard View**, that knowledge is justified true belief
>   plus something else. JTB+

-   **Internalists** argue that a feature of belief in virtue
    of which it is justified must, in some sense, be internal
    to the person that holds it.
    -   **Externalists** deny this.
    
-   **Reliabalists** think that justification comes from reliable
    belief-forming processes, reliably leading to truth.
-   Goldman rejected justification in 'A Causal Theory of Knowing'.
    -   He has said little in writing about this.

September 9th, 2013 <small>1st Meeting on Kornblith</small>
-----------------------------------------------------------

-   Descartes thinks that knowledge needs to be indubitable. 
-   Moore says "he knows that he has a hand," and so if any theory
	attests he doesn't, it's a bad theory.
	-   It's because he knows that he has a hand more than he knows your
		theory of knowledge.

-   You can tether a belief to truth with justification.
	-   Gettier said this wasn't good enough because you can have a justified
		true belief that isn't knowledge.
		-   Gettier cases do not entail the proposition which is false.

-   Here are two ways of talking about justification.
	-   Defeasiblility theory.
	-   Reliabalism.

-   There are two ways of solving Gettier.
	-   Ramping up evidence.
	-   Add a causal condition.
	-   Neither challenge justification.

-   Kornblith shows that justification isn't a necessary condition of 
	knowledge, his formulation.
-   Read carefully footnote 24.

September 11th, 2013 <small>2nd Meeting on Kornblith</small>
------------------------------------------------------------

-   Starting with AJ Ayer and Alvin Goldman, what tied truth to
    belief was reliable process.
    -   You might offer as reasons for belief an absolutely terrible
        reason.
        -   You might still know it if the belief was formed by
            a reliable process.
    
    -   You might provide fallacious reasoning, but if the all
        the processes you used reliably produce truth, then
        you know.
    -   Here's a case where the traditions will come apart:
        -   Think of the gypsie fortune teller who can predict
            the winner of the horse race.
        -   And they can predict the next one. And the next one.
            And over and over again.
        -   They don't know that they can get it right, but they
            believe it.
        -   They think knowledge is a property that many other
            animals have.
        -   Knowledge is a representational state.
        -   The gypsie fortune-teller knows because the representation                
        -   Does that mean our epistemic evaluation of the fortune-teller
            and the horse-race-scientist with rational reasons has to be the same?
            Not better?

-   Supervinience is when a set of properties *A* supervenes on a set *B*
    if and only if a change in the set of *A* properties implies a change in 
    the set of *B* properties.
-   Types of justification
    -   Doxastic justification is the belief state of justification actualized.
        -   This is what reliabilists are interested in.
        
    -   Propositional justification is the belief state of justification potentially.

-   Arguements on paper or dialetical arguments
    -   Public (community)
        -   Epistemic communities
        -   Contextualism
        
    -   Private
        -   Cartesian
        -   Foley

-   Argument:
	1.  There are only *x* levels of justification.
	2.  None of the *x* levels of justification are necessary for knowledge.
	3.  Therefore, justification is not necessary for knowledge.

-   There are two forms of justification for Kornblith:
	1.  Objective.
	2.  Subjective, of which there are:
		1.  Public, of where there are:
			1.  Contextualist
			2.  Equal?

		2.  Private

-   Galileo had knowledge but did not satisfy the requirements of the community.
	-   Your community can have totally kooky reasons for believing what they do.
	-   So you can have knowledge without satisfying their requirements.

-   The contextualist account of justification.
	-   It's that the standards for justification vary based on context.
	-   Suppose I say, along with Keith DeRose and Stewart Cohen, has this example:
		-   Consider a case *A* where a husband and wife are driving their car and the
			husband said, "I'd like to deposit this cheque in the bank."
		-   "How is the bank open?"
		-   "It was open last Saturday, and I think I remember seeing a sign."
		-   The person knew, therefore? We count this as knowledge.
		-   Now suppose the same case, but Klein is the person who has to deposit
			the cheque and it is absolutely crucial that Klein get it in, otherwise
			Klein will lose his house, money, etc.
		-   It's important to see what contextualists mean, *S* **knows** that *p*.
			-   "Know" is **attributor relative**, where it is like "here", "now",
				"I", "we."
			-   Attributor relative something reflexive â€¦

	-   Suppose Klein has very high standards, close to the Cartesian, and he says
		that you don't know unless you can eliminate all standards for doubt.
		-   Hume says the only way to avoid doubts, ignore the doubts of philosophers.

-   Closure where *h* = "I have a hand."
	1.  If *S* knows that *h*, then *S* knows that there is no evil genius making
		*S* falsely believe that *h*.
		-   I disagree, because it is possible that *S* can know that *h* **and**
			*S* can falsely believe *h*. How? Because if the evil genius made
			*S* believe that *h* and *h* were actually true, it would be an
			instance of falsely believing despite being true. How? Because
			the belief that *h* would violate the norms of believing.
		-   I think this argument may be abusing "believing falsely" by
			making it seem like the only way to do that is to believe something
			that is false. I think it's confusing because of perspective.
			Replace "belief" with "know", perhaps?
		-   Yes. It is not necessarily true that if *S* knows that *h*, then
			*S* doesn't falsely believe, because what the consequent should be
			is falsely *know* that *h*.
	2.  *S* doesn't know that there is not an evil genius.
		-   This means you have to be able to defeat all other cases.
	3.  Therefore, *S* doesn't know that *h*.
