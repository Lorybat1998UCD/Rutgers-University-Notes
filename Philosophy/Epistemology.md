------------------------------------------------------

### Lecture

> What's Gettier's main point?

-   JTB is not complete because there are cases where JTB isn't knowledge.
    -   JTB is not sufficient for knowledge.
    
-   What he's after is, ... how does he argue for it?
    -   One strategy he is uses is describing cases where you have
        justification and belief and (by accident) truth.
        >   Yeah, Jones/Smith has a JTB, but he does not have
        >   knowledge.
        
-   Two claims about justification:
>   1.   **The Closure Principle**
>        -   What does it mean for a set of objects to be closed?
>        -   Every member of the set is related to every other member?
>       
>   2.  **The K-thesis**
>       1.  Kp $\to$ KKP
>       2.  Kp $\to$ KKK ... Kp

-   To know that `p` is to know everything about the concepts of `p`.
    -   To know that `Kp` you probably need to have the concepts of `K`, "knowledge."
    -   Therefore, if you don't know about knowing you can't know (?).
    
-   Look at the simple justification closure principle.
    -   Counterexamples?

### Reading <small>by Hilary Kornblith</small>

>   **The Standard View**, that knowledge is justified true belief
>   plus something else. JTB+

#### Chapter 1 <small>Knowledge doesn't require justification</small>

-   **Internalists** argue that a feature of belief in virtue
    of which it is justified must, in some sense, be internal
    to the person that holds it.
    -   **Externalists** deny this.
    
-   **Reliabalists** think that justification comes from reliable
    belief-forming processes, reliably leading to truth.
-   Goldman rejected justification in 'A Causal Theory of Knowing'.
    -   He has said little in writing about this.

------------------------------------------

-   Descartes thinks that knowledge needs to be indubitable. 
-   Moore says "he knows that he has a hand," and so if any theory
	attests he doesn't, it's a bad theory.
	-   It's because he knows that he has a hand more than he knows your
		theory of knowledge.

-   You can tether a belief to truth with justification.
	-   Gettier said this wasn't good enough because you can have a justified
		true belief that isn't knowledge.
		-   Gettier cases do not entail the proposition which is false.

-   Here are two ways of talking about justification.
	-   Defeasiblility theory.
	-   Reliabalism.

-   There are two ways of solving Gettier.
	-   Ramping up evidence.
	-   Add a causal condition.
	-   Neither challenge justification.

-   Kornblith shows that justification isn't a necessary condition of 
	knowledge, his formulation.
-   Read carefully footnote 24.
