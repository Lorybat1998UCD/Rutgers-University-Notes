Epistemology <small>with Peter Klein</small>
============================================

September 4th, 2013 <small>The Gettier Problem</small>
------------------------------------------------------

> What's Gettier's main point?

-   JTB is not complete because there are cases where JTB isn't
    knowledge.
    -   JTB is not sufficient for knowledge.

-   What he's after is, ... how does he argue for it?
    -   One strategy he is uses is describing cases where you have
        justification and belief and (by accident) truth. \> Yeah,
        Jones/Smith has a JTB, but he does not have \> knowledge.

-   To know that `p` is to know everything about the concepts of `p`.
    -   To know that `Kp` you probably need to have the concepts of `K`,
        "knowledge."
    -   Therefore, if you don't know about knowing you can't know (?).

-   Look at the simple justification closure principle.
    -   Counterexamples?

September 9th, 2013 <small>Reading, 'Knowledge Needs No Justification', Hilary Kornblith</small>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> **The Standard View**, that knowledge is justified true belief plus
> something else. JTB+

-   **Internalists** argue that a feature of belief in virtue of which
    it is justified must, in some sense, be internal to the person that
    holds it.
    -   **Externalists** deny this.

-   **Reliabalists** think that justification comes from reliable
    belief-forming processes, reliably leading to truth.
-   Goldman rejected justification in 'A Causal Theory of Knowing'.
    -   He has said little in writing about this.
    -   In "A Causal Theory of Knowing", Goldman argued that knowledge
        of p is nothing more than true belief caused by the fact that p.

### 2. Dialectical conceptions of justification

-   Justification is seen as a matter of the ability to present
    arguments in support of one's beliefs.
-   In the case of scientific communities, the ability to respond to
    arguments from one's community may be central to one's knowledge.
-   Note that not all communities are like this, for instance
    astrologers with tea leaves.
    -   The scientific community is highly idiosyncratic.

-   If justification is identified with the ability to respond to
    socially available challenges, then justification is not a necessary
    condition for knowledge.
-   If justification is identified with the process of reflecting on
    one's beliefs, then justification is not a necessary condition for
    knowledge.

> The dialectical conception of justification, whether in its social
> form-which requires an ability to justify one's beliefs to one's
> community-or in its more individualist form-which requires that one be
> in a position to justify one's beliefs to oneself, does not present us
> with a plausible necessary condition on knowledge.

### 3. Objective conceptions of justification

-   While objective standards for justification do not suffer from the
    same trouble of being arbitrary that dialectical ones do, Kornblith
    thinks that the more objective you make the standards, the less
    plausible it is that these standards of justification.
-   Consider probabilistic standards.
    -   It's widely implausible that any agent can compute the crazy
        complicated independent and dependent conjunctions and
        disjunctions of propositions and their probability.
    -   So it's a little weird to impose standards that are
        unachievable.

-   There will always be a gap between the *actual* reliability of a
    process and the *perceived* reliability of a process, and so this is
    no grounds for justicational objectivity.

### 4. Conclusion

-   Failure to meet the standards of justification, either dialectical
    or objective, is evidence that one does not know.
    -   But it is *not* a necessary condition.

-   Failure to meet the standards for justification deprives one of
    knowledge even if justification is not a necessary condition for
    knowledge.
    -   Consider Jack, who has a lucky guess belief that is true which
        he thinks is knowledge.
    -   When ask to satisfy the standards of his community, he will be
        unable to and will give up on his knowledge claim.
    -   When made to satisfy his own standards, he will be unable to and
        thus no longer believe it.
    -   It's no longer knowledge.

September 9th, 2013 <small>1st Meeting on Kornblith</small>
-----------------------------------------------------------

-   Descartes thinks that knowledge needs to be indubitable.
-   Moore says "he knows that he has a hand," and so if any theory
    attests he doesn't, it's a bad theory.
    -   It's because he knows that he has a hand more than he knows your
        theory of knowledge.

-   You can tether a belief to truth with justification.
    -   Gettier said this wasn't good enough because you can have a
        justified true belief that isn't knowledge.
        -   Gettier cases do not entail the proposition which is false.

-   Here are two ways of talking about justification.
    -   Defeasiblility theory.
    -   Reliabalism.

-   There are two ways of solving Gettier.
    -   Ramping up evidence.
    -   Add a causal condition.
    -   Neither challenge justification.

-   Kornblith shows that justification isn't a necessary condition of
    knowledge, his formulation.
-   Read carefully footnote 24.

September 11th, 2013 <small>2nd Meeting on Kornblith</small>
------------------------------------------------------------

-   Starting with AJ Ayer and Alvin Goldman, what tied truth to belief
    was reliable process.
    -   You might offer as reasons for belief an absolutely terrible
        reason.
        -   You might still know it if the belief was formed by a
            reliable process.

    -   You might provide fallacious reasoning, but if the all the
        processes you used reliably produce truth, then you know.
    -   Here's a case where the traditions will come apart:
        -   Think of the gypsie fortune teller who can predict the
            winner of the horse race.
        -   And they can predict the next one. And the next one. And
            over and over again.
        -   They don't know that they can get it right, but they believe
            it.
        -   They think knowledge is a property that many other animals
            have.
        -   Knowledge is a representational state.
        -   The gypsie fortune-teller knows because the representation\
        -   Does that mean our epistemic evaluation of the
            fortune-teller and the horse-race-scientist with rational
            reasons has to be the same? Not better?

-   Supervinience is when a set of properties *A* supervenes on a set
    *B* if and only if a change in the set of *A* properties implies a
    change in the set of *B* properties.
-   Types of justification
    -   Doxastic justification is the belief state of justification
        actualized.
        -   This is what reliabilists are interested in.

    -   Propositional justification is the belief state of justification
        potentially.

-   Arguements on paper or dialetical arguments
    -   Public (community)
        -   Epistemic communities
        -   Contextualism

    -   Private
        -   Cartesian
        -   Foley

September 16th, 2013 <small>3rd Meeting on Kornblith</small>
------------------------------------------------------------

-   Argument:
    1.  There are only *x* levels of justification.
    2.  None of the *x* levels of justification are necessary for
        knowledge.
    3.  Therefore, justification is not necessary for knowledge.

-   There are two forms of justification for Kornblith:
    1.  Objective.
    2.  Subjective, of which there are:
        1.  Public, of where there are:
            1.  Contextualist
            2.  Equal?

        2.  Private

-   Galileo had knowledge but did not satisfy the requirements of the
    community.
    -   Your community can have totally kooky reasons for believing what
        they do.
    -   So you can have knowledge without satisfying their requirements.

-   The contextualist account of justification.
    -   It's that the standards for justification vary based on context.
    -   Suppose I say, along with Keith DeRose and Stewart Cohen, has
        this example:
        -   Consider a case *A* where a husband and wife are driving
            their car and the husband said, "I'd like to deposit this
            cheque in the bank."
        -   "How is the bank open?"
        -   "It was open last Saturday, and I think I remember seeing a
            sign."
        -   The person knew, therefore? We count this as knowledge.
        -   Now suppose the same case, but Klein is the person who has
            to deposit the cheque and it is absolutely crucial that
            Klein get it in, otherwise Klein will lose his house, money,
            etc.
        -   It's important to see what contextualists mean, *S*
            **knows** that *p*.
            -   "Know" is **attributor relative**, where it is like
                "here", "now", "I", "we."
            -   Attributor relative something reflexive â€¦

    -   Suppose Klein has very high standards, close to the Cartesian,
        and he says that you don't know unless you can eliminate all
        standards for doubt.
        -   Hume says the only way to avoid doubts, ignore the doubts of
            philosophers.

-   Closure where *h* = "I have a hand."
    1.  If *S* knows that *h*, then *S* knows that there is no evil
        genius making *S* falsely believe that *h*.
        -   I disagree, because it is possible that *S* can know that
            *h* **and** *S* can falsely believe *h*. How? Because if the
            evil genius made *S* believe that *h* and *h* were actually
            true, it would be an instance of falsely believing despite
            being true. How? Because the belief that *h* would violate
            the norms of believing.
        -   I think this argument may be abusing "believing falsely" by
            making it seem like the only way to do that is to believe
            something that is false. I think it's confusing because of
            perspective. Replace "belief" with "know", perhaps?
        -   Yes. It is not necessarily true that if *S* knows that *h*,
            then *S* doesn't falsely believe, because what the
            consequent should be is falsely *know* that *h*.

    2.  *S* doesn't know that there is not an evil genius.
        -   This means you have to be able to defeat all other cases.

    3.  Therefore, *S* doesn't know that *h*.

September 18th, 2013 <small>Reading, 'Useful False Beliefs', Peter Klein</small>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Purpose: Examine the role of false beliefs in the production of
    knowledge.

### Key notions

1.  **Propositional** vs. **Doxastic** justification.
    -   Propositions are the contents of beliefs.
    -   *S* can be **propositionally justified** and not believe *p*.

2.  **Causal** and **evidential overdetermination**
    -   An event or state is *causally overdetermined* if and only if it
        has at least two actual causes of which, in the actual
        circumstances, acted as a sufficient cause to produce the state
        or event.
    -   A proposition *p* is *evidentially overdetermined* for *S* if
        and only if there exists at least two independent bases
        available for *S* each of which is sufficient to propositionally
        justify *p*.

        $$ E(S) \iff \exists e_1 e_2 ( J_S p ) \land e_1 \neq e_2 $$

3.  **Knowledge**
    -   *S*'s doxastically justified, true belief falls short of being
        knowledge if *S* felicitously acquired the true belief on the
        basis of part of the relevant evidence when some other part of
        the evidence, if combined with the evidence *S* did acquire,
        defeats the justification.
    -   *S* inferentially knows that *h* if and only if:
        1.  *h* is true;
        2.  *S* believes that *h*;
        3.  *S*'s belief that *h* is inferred from and doxastically
            justified by another belief, say the belief that *e*, which
            is doxastically justified.
        4.  There is no genuine defeater of the propositional
            justification of any of the propositions in the evidential
            path up to and including *e*, and there is no genuine
            defeater of the propositional justification of any
            proposition between *e* and *h*.

### A review of Gettier

-   Two Gettier principles:

> III. Fallibilism: A person, *S*, can be doxastically justified in
>     believing a proposition, *p*, and *p* can be false.
>
> IV. Closure: If a person, *S*, is doxastically justified in believing
>     a proposition, *p*, and *p* entails *q*, and *S* comes to believe
>     that *q* on the basis of deducing it from *p*, then *S* is
>     doxastically justified in believing that *p*.

### Examples and prelimnary discussion of useful falsehoods

1.  The Appointment Case
    -   Klein believes that his secretary told him on Friday that he has
        an appointment with a student on Monday.
    -   Klein *does* have an appointment with his student on Monday.
    -   His secretary told him on Thursday, however.
    -   There is an available, undefeated, propositional evidential
        chain for the belief that Klein has an appointment on Monday,
        but Klein took an evidential path which contained a false
        proposition.

2.  The Santa Claus Case
    -   Mom and Dad tell Virginia that Santa will put presents under the
        tree.
    -   She infers that there will be presents under the tree.
    -   There will be presents under the tree. The intuition is that,
        therefore, she knows!

3.  The Average Rainfall Case
    -   Weatherman believes that the average annual precipitation in
        Northwest Montana is about 13 inches.
    -   He believes this on the grounds that there have been accurate
        records for over 80 years, and 13 inches is what they say.
    -   The average rainfall *is* 13 inches, but records have only been
        kept for 79 years.
    -   He knows.

4.  The Ptolemaic Astronomer Case
    -   In Oxford University in astronomy class, the best Ptolemaic
        astronomer taught students to calculate the relative positions
        of planets with the Ptolemaic model.
    -   The Professor asks students whether Mars will be visible in 800
        years from now, assuming Mars and Earth exist and visibility is
        good.
    -   The students accurately determine whether Mars will be visible,
        say the answer is yes.
    -   They know.

### The proposed characterization of useful falsehoods

-   The belief that *uf* is a useful falsehood to *S* for acquiring
    knowledge that *h* by producing a doxastically justified belief that
    *h* if and only if:
    1.  *uf* is false;
        -   Analytically required that *uf* must be false.

    2.  The belief that *uf* is doxastically justified for *S*;
        -   An instance of the general requirement that doxastic
            justification which depends on another beliefs requires that
            belief to be doxastically justified.

    3.  The belief that *uf* is essential in the causal production of
        the belief that *h*;
        -   Analytically contained in the notion of a *useful* falsehood
            that justifies *h*, since such falsehoods, unlike the
            so-called harmless ones, are essential in producing
            doxastically justified beliefs.

    4.  *uf* propositionally justifies *h*;
        -   Follows from the general account of doxastic justification
            given earlier. One consequence of that account is that, if
            the belief that *uf* doxastically justifies the belief that
            *h*, then *uf* propositionally justifies *h*.

    5.  *uf* entails a true proposition *t*;
    6.  *t* propositionally justified *h*;
        -   This might look redundant, but it isn't because it isn't
            necessarily true for all cases, isn't generally true about
            justification.

    7.  Whatever doxastically justifies the belief that *uf* for *S*
        also propositionally justified *t* for *S*.

> justificatory path taken by the agent, there is no genuine defeater
> along the path not taken.

September 18th, 2013 <small>1st Meeting on Klein</small>
--------------------------------------------------------

### Some background

-   What most people think Gettier showed was that JTB was not
    *sufficient* for knowledge, not that they were not *necessary*.
    -   A lot of people thought that this may mean there is another
        condition, and the first attempt was **evidentialism**.
    -   The way that epistemologists initially attempted to solve this
        way by beefing up the justification condition.
    -   The recipe is find a false belief your justified in, find a true
        proposition that it entails, using closure.
        -   This belief will be true and justified which you believe on
            the basis of the deduction from a false justified belief.

-   Clark grants that JTB is not sufficient, and the way that he solves
    the Gettier problem is by saying the proposition that you use as
    evidence must be a JTB for you.
    -   If you get to the evidence or belief by chains of inference,
        they must all be true.
    -   It must be **fully-grounded**, if there is something false in
        there, it will be "lucky break" that you had a JTB.
    -   This is the first evidentialist approach.

### Evidentialism

-   **Disjunctive normal form**: $\lbrace a, b, c, d ... x \rbrace$:

    $$\exists x F(x) \equiv F(a) \lor F(b) \lor F(c) \lor ... $$

-   Michael Clark came up with a case where you have justified, true,
    belief that whose basis is good and you *still* do not have
    knowledge.
    -   Klein comes to believe that Ben owns a Ford.
    -   As it turns out, Ben stole the Ford.
    -   He has a valid-looking title, and there's testimony that he
        bought it, etc.
    -   Klein comes to believe that someone in the class owns a Ford on
        the basis that Ben owns a Ford.
    -   As it turns out, someone does own a Ford in the class, but
        clearly not Ben.
    -   Imagine that Klein is epistemically careful, a careful reasoner.
        He notes that it's more likely that someone owns a Ford, and
        that the belief is less likely to be wrong, less risky.
        -   This clever reasoner did not make use of any false belief.

-   Consider another case: Klein has good evidence that Ben and Sherri
    own a Ford. Ben does not, Sherri does. Klein believes on these
    grounds that "someone owns a Ford."
    -   This is **epistemically overdetermined**, having two ways to get
        to the same belief, one false, one true, and still knowledge.

-   You can *always* fix a theory which is supposedly defeated by a
    counterexample by just ad-hoc ruling out the counter-example. But
    it's just that, it's *ad-hoc*.
    -   So evidentialism was supposed to not work (for now).

### Defeasibility

-   Many people think that **defeasibility theory** is part of the
    evidentialist tradition.
    -   The expression "defeasibility" comes from ethics.

-   Say *E* is the set of all evidence, for and against, a proposition
    *p*.
-   *e* is the set of evidence which justifies *S* in believing *p*.
    Notation: $$e J_S p$$

-   A good definition takes the cases where almost it's almost
    universally thought someone has knowledge and validates it, where
    it's almost universally thought someone doesn't and validates it,
    and where it's almost universally vague and clarifies it and why
    it's vague.

### Reliablism

-   There can be misleading evidence, so defeasibility eliminates too
    much.
    -   The simple defensibility theory isn't good, that, looks too
        strong.
    -   Many people thought that defeasibility didn't work.
    -   There was an alternatively available, which fit really nicely
        with naturalized epistemology.

-   Some people think that if you want to know what knowledge is, you
    shouldn't sit in your EZ chair and thinking about.
    -   Just like if you want to figure out what gold is, you go study
        gold things.
    -   If you want to study knowledge, go become a cognitive scientist
        or psychologist.
    -   Knowledge is the end of a process, *go and study the process*!

-   The first shot was Alvin Goldman's paper, 'A Causal Theory of
    Knowledge.'
    -   Knowledge happens in the brain, in the mind.
    -   Knowledge, therefore, has a certain causal genealogy.
    -   The object has to be in the causal history of the belief.
    -   Suppose I look outside the window and I believe there will be
        rain in ten minutes. That belief cannot be caused by the rain in
        the ten minutes because the causal chain isn't temporally there
        yet.

-   Sometimes this is called internalist, where evidentialists and
    defeasibility theorists are called externalists.
-   Barn facade case:
    -   Supose you're going through phony barn country.
    -   A hurricane has come through upper Vermont, but people come for
        the barns.
    -   The tourist agency think that this will destroy the industry, so
        they put up facades.
    -   You're going through the country, and you see the *1* real barn.
    -   The barn is appropriately caused, it's justified true belief,
        but the intuition is that it is not knowledge.

September 23rd, 2013 <small>2nd Meeting on Klein</small>
--------------------------------------------------------

-   The recipe for Gettier cases is having a false, justified that
    entails a true belief, and you have an accident!
    -   The general view is that Gettier basically shows that there
        cannot be a useful falsehood.
    -   The way you work out what is essential evidence is dropping it
        from the set of evidence justifying a belief, and if it no
        longer justifies the belief, it was essential. If it still
        justifies, it's a harmless falsehoods.

-   You are entitled to believe a proposition if and only if you believe
    the proposition on the grounds of the propositions which reliably
    get that proposition on the grounds of the evidence.
    -   You're doxasticly entitled to a belief if the propositional
        evidence justifies you.

September 25th, 2013 <small>3rd Meeting on Klein</small>
--------------------------------------------------------

-   The initial response to the Gettier literature was the **no false
    grounds** view, where every justifier cannot be false.
    -   This will not be enough because of the clever reasoner knows
        that "someone owns a Ford" from "Nogot owns a Ford", and as it
        turns out "Havit owns a Ford" and Havit is someone.
        -   False grounds, true justified belief, knowledge.
        -   The clever reasoner is careful and is less likely to be
            wrong with the someone clause.
        -   This gets rid of this conditions necessity.

    -   Cases of epistemic overdetermination will show that it isn't
        even sufficient.

-   Most foundationalists who are reliablists think that there are basic
    proposition and beliefs which justify all other propositions and
    beliefs.
-   An essential falsehood is when if you remove it, you can no longer
    be justified in believing truth.
-   If you're stuck on a long paper and you've found an objection,
    instead of giving up on the paper, just counter it and clench
    victory from the jaws of the philosophical community.
-   The problem of useful falsehoods is a problem for evidentialists,
    defeasibility theorists, *and* reliablists.
    -   The generality problem for reliablists is an instance of many
        different processes.
        -   For reliablists, they have to say that useful falsehoods are
            part of a reliable process, whereas harmful falsehoods are
            not. So there's a way out!

    -   For defeasibility, there is the distinction between genuine and
        misleading defeaters *a la* Grabit and Grabit's brother.

September 30th, 2013 <small>Reading, 'Immediate Justification and Process Reliablism', Alvin Goldman</small>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

-   Is there a species of prima facie justification that is immediate,
    direct, basic, or foundational?
    -   It is puzzling whether and how immediate justification could
        arise.
    -   This is the *core issue* for foundationalists and coherentists.
    -   An older conception is that some beliefs are
        **self-justifying**, that they do not need anything *else* to
        justify them but themselves.
        -   This is no longer very popular.

-   In general, there are justifying factors that are **doxastic** and
    **propositional**, where propositional does not presuppose that the
    agent actually believe the target justifying factor and doxastic
    *does*.
-   There are three central questions:
    1.  Is there a species of justification that is immediate, direct,
        or basic?
        -   Are some beliefs made justified in virtue of states of
            affairs or processes that confer justification without
            *themselves* being justified?

    2.  If yes, how is immediate justification conferral possible?
        -   What is wrong with the arguments *against* unjustified
            justifiers.

    3.  Assuming that these arguments are invalid, what types of states
        or processes can serve as immediate justification?

-   Must the unjustified justifiers themselves be contentful? Three
    possible answers:
    1.  Immediate justifiers are contentful for the agent.
    2.  Immediate justifiers are non-contentful.
    3.  They can be either.

### Feldman's proposal <small>A proper response to experience</small>

> Being spontaneously formed makes a belief immediately justified.

-   This is quickly rejected with an alternative with an addendum of
    "proper response to experience"

> A spontaneously formed belief is justified provided it is a proper
> response to experience and is not defeated by other evidence the
> believer has.

September 30th, 2013 <small>1st Meeting on Goldman</small>
----------------------------------------------------------

-   Suppose there is some belief Bp.
    -   "Belief is true" -\> propositional content
    -   "She had the belief" -\> belief state
    -   "Justified belief"
        -   Could mean the *believing* is justified. "You're not
            justified to that *state*"
        -   The content of the state, "You don't have good enough
            evidence" or "You have good evidence but there's this
            opposing view."

-   When Goldman talks about coherentism,
    -   You could talk about self-justified beliefs
    -   If you're familiar with Aristotle you'll see the epistemic
        regress is part of a lot of regresses that Aristotle wanted to
        avoid.

-   What is the traditional view? *Crude* Aristotle.
    -   Suppose you say, here's a substance. It can have two types of
        properties:
        1.  Essential properties, it is necessary that the substance
            have this property. If it loses it, it is no longer that
            substance.
        2.  Accidental properties, it acquires and loses this property.

-   Coherentism
    -   Bad form, circular reasoning
    -   Better form

October 9th, 2013 <small>1st Meeting on Conee & Feldman</small>
---------------------------------------------------------------

-   Suppose you're driving along, and you see what you take to be what
    is someone walking through a brick wall.
    -   Well, you're *prima facie* justified in believing that that
        person is walking through the wall, but you're not going to
        think you have *ultima facie* justification.
    -   It can be quickly overruled.

> Why when geese fly why is it that one leg is longer than the other?
>
> More geese.

-   There are **direct realists** and **indirect realists**
    -   *Direct realists* think that the basic propositions in
        foundational justification are states of affairs,
        -   "There are tables."
        -   Claim about physical objects.

    -   *Indirect realists*
        -   Direct, non-inferential knowledge of objects.
        -   I'm not just aware of ideas, I can infer there are physical
            objects with constant properties.

    -   *Idealists*
        -   This is not "'ideal'-ist", it is "'idea'-ist."
        -   The only things that exists are ideas and collections of
            ideas.

-   If you think of a mind of something like a room where all we see is
    something like images on the wall, like Plato's cave, I *could*
    infer that these correspond to non mind-independent, but I do not
    necessarily.
    -   How do I get *out of mind*?

-   What Huemer thinks is that if I am having a phenomenal experience,
    then I am entitled to the belief, and the belief is knowledge if the
    proposition is not overridden by other knowledge I have.
    -   So this is where there is *prima facie*, "non-overriden."
    -   And then there is *ultima facie*, "undefeated."

-   Goldman is saying that there is the belief, "I have a pain."
    -   Most people have taken this type of belief to be a basic belief.
    -   If they're like Huemer, also tables, because there are basic
        beliefs about the world and about internal mental states.
        -   If indirect realism is correct there has to be a seeming
            that there is a pain distinct from having a pain.

-   Suppose you are just terrible at distinguishing a tickle from a
    pain, then you would, in some sense, could be wrong about *how it
    seems to you*.
    -   You're just terrible at classifying pains.
    -   It's propositional *enough* in the sense that you could say it
        about the seemings for the person going through the wall.
        -   I'm not sure if you should categorize that as going through
            a wall or as a person.

    -   There are people that believe they have pains that do not,
        psychological problems, etc.

October 14th, 2013 <small>2nd Meeting on Conee & Feldman</small>
----------------------------------------------------------------

-   Foundationalists think that there is a causal chain from basic
    beliefs to more complex beliefs.
    -   They will try to explain how the belief is caused by evidence,
        or "the proposition."
    -   Suppose I believe something on basis of bad evidence, I do not
        know it. Suppose I come to believe it on good evidence, does the
        citing reasons and justification make you doxastically
        justifiers.

October 16th, 2013 <small>'Experiential Justification' by Anthony Brueckner</small>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The topic is *justification and perceptual beliefs*.
-   The most attractive view of perceptual justification is that
    perceptual beliefs *are justified* in virtue of their relation to
    *propositional-content-bearing* experiences.

### Perception Beliefs and Theories of Justification

-   At first pass, perceptual beliefs are beliefs that are caused by
    perceptual experiences. Though this is too narrow and too wide
    because:
    1.  Seeing a red cup *can* cause the belief that 2 + 3 = 5
    2.  Wide, because hallucinations

-   Characterizing it in terms of propositions is problematic because
    the belief with content that a red cup is present could well be
    caused in multifarious ways.
-   Some questions:
    1.  Do perceptual beliefs amount to knowledge?
    2.  When, if ever, are perceptual beliefs justified?
        -   *How* are they justified?

    3.  *In virtue of what* are justified perceptual beliefs justified?

-   Theories of justification:
    -   Coheretism, justified beliefs depend for their justification
        upon their relations to other beliefs.
        -   *Pure* coherentism is all justified beliefs being justified
            in relation to other beliefs.

### An application of the Foregoing Categorization

-   Williamson thinks that "E = K", that one's *knowledge* is *equal* to
    what one *evidentially believes*.
    -   Experiences are never justifiers for one's perceptual beliefs
        because experiences are obviously not believed propositions.

-   Then, Williamson has two options:
    1.  Adopt that foundational beliefs are justified without
        justifiers.
    2.  A version of coherentism.

-   Coherentism *is not* explored in *Knowledge and its Limits*, so
    Williamson's view is undetermined.

### Experiential Justification

-   Returning to foundationalism, how do perceptual *experiences*
    justify perceptual *beliefs*?
    -   Perhaps the belief is caused by the experience and the
        experience is cause by the thing in itself.
        -   This leaves no rational for holding that perceptual beliefs
            caused by *illusory* experiences.

> Beliefs have propositional content, while perceptual representations
> have non-propositional content. Both states can be **veridical**:
> beliefs are veridical when their propositional truth conditions are
> satisfied; perceptual experiences are veridical when their
> non-propositional correctness conditions are satisfied (as we find in
> the cases of good maps and accurate photographs).

-   If an experience has a propositional content, as does a belief, then
    the experience is to that degree belief-like.

October 21st, 2013 <small>Is Infinitism the Solution to the Regress Problem?<small>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### On Connee/Feldman

-   Most moral principle are defeasible.
    -   "Don't lie." *Well, the Nazis are the door ...*
    -   "Keep promises." *Well, your friend loaned you a gun, and
        they're in no state to have a gun.*
    -   These are called "rules of thumb." Where the rule of thumb was
        that an inch is roughly the length of a thumb.

-   The way to solve the Gettier problem for deafisbility theorist is:

    $$ K = JTB + E = eJ_sp = (e \land d)\lnot J_s p $$

-   If knowledge is sometimes vague, that doesn't mean knowledge is
    always vague.

### The Regress Problem

> The phrase "I suspend judgement" we adopt in place of I am unable to
> say which of the objects presented I should believe or which I should
> disbelieve. As to whether we are equal we cannot say. ... Neither
> affirms nor denies anything.

-   He's not saying an "ought to suspend," because that's a dogmatic
    claim.

> I determine *nothing*, to put forward something not evident. We hold
> that to determine is not simply to. For in this sense no doubt we will
> be found a skeptic determines nothing, not even the expression that
> nothing is determinable.

-   The problem with Pyrhonnian skepticism. Here's how they solve it:
-   The modes were meant to form suspension on judgment.
-   The Platonic skeptics thought the Pyrrohnian skeptics were dogmatic
    because the conclusions would be "I don't know.", whereas they
    concluded, "I don't know if I know."

October 28rd, 2013 <small>Ginet's Response to Klein</small>
-----------------------------------------------------------

-   "Klein has confused being able to answer questions about
	justifiedness with the state of being justifiedness."
	-   Fred doesn't have to be able to do this in order to
		be justified. It's not about the justification, it's
		about how justification arises.
	-   The *fact* about justification is that it arises in
		a foundational way.

-   On *a priori* beliefs, on pg. 142, Ginet will say, 
	>   The fact that he understands it *is* his justification 
	>   for believing it, because that fact entails his believing
	>   it.
	-   Merely *understanding* that "5 + 3 = 9" is not sufficient
		for have a JTB. Does merely understanding do it?
	-   My understanding is that "5 + 4 = 9" and this implies that
		"5 + 3 = 9" is false.
		-   So what's the difference between understanding and 
			understanding it's true.
		-   "I understand what it means for *x* to be true."

-   Many people think that suppose I want to argue that arguing
	for something is a good way to show that it's true.
	-   "Arguing is a good way to show something is true. Give
		me reasons and inferences and deductions."
	-   Suppose someone argues that, "Reason to the best 
		explanation is the best explanation for how to get 
		the truth or something."
		-   This is not typical circular reasoning. Circular
			reasoning is when the conclusion of an argument is
			contained in the premises from which the conclusion
			was argued.
		-   Begging the question has to do with the form of the
			argument.

	-   "What's the best way to argue for something?" Suppose Klein
		responds, "$W_1$", well what's the best way for arguing for
		that? "$W_2$", well why aren't you giving me your *best*
		way?
		-   If my practice is going to be consistent with my
			belief, I have to use my *best way*, which isn't
			way 2, it's way 1. If you ask for the best way and
			I use it, you cannot be mad, because if I were to
			use another way, you would say why didn't I use
			my way?
		-   I'm not assuming the proposition I'm trying to prove,
			the proposition I'm trying to prove is about the method
			I use to prove it.

October 30th, 2013 <small>'Skeptical and Perceptual Knowledge' by Ernest Sosa</small>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Dreams pose a deeper problem than that a BIV or EDD
	-   In what follows Sosa takes up this paradox.
	-   First, a heterodox conception of dreams.
	-   Second, a resolution based on a conception of knowlege
		as apt belief.

### Varieties of skepticism

-   There are many forms.
	-   The **Pyrrhonian** suspends judgment using tropes that
		counter any reasons offered in favor of belief.
	-   The **Academic** are more assertive, by claiming that
		we know nothing
		-   In general or some large department of common sense or science.

	-   Any attempt to refute this claims will *beg the question*.
		-   Using *implicit claims of the realm in general*.

-   *Irrefutable does not mean true.*
	-   If refuting such a skeptic requires adducing some premise,
		to do which is implictly claim knowledge of its truth,
		so we're *bound to beg the question*.

-   Such varieties of skepticism are less problematic than the variety
	of main interest to Sosa.
	-   At the heart of common sense, our skeptic claims to find a
		commitment that precludes knowledge
		-   Either in general or in some main department.
	
	-   According to this commitment, a belief can only amount to knowledge
		if it is **sensitive**.
		-   Which means *had its contents been false, then it would
			not have been believed by the believer*.

### Skepticism, sensitivity, and safety

-   If a sensitivity requirement is indeed at the core of common sense,
	it puts the skeptic in a good position.
	-   Belief that one is not radicallt misled turns out to be
		insensitive.
	-   Radical scenarios are constructed to secure this result.

Basis-relative sensitivity

:   A belief constitutes knowledge if and only if 
	had it been false, then the believer would not have
	held it on the same basis on which he actually holds it.

-   This is not helpful unless we externalize perceptual bases for belief.
	-   Had its content been false, then trivially, it ould not have been
		a *factive* basis, since any such basis has to be veridical.

-   However, consider a normal perceiver and a counterpart BIV.
	-   Deprived of factive perception, a BIV must bases their justified
		beliefs on something more internal than that.

-   The appeal to perceptual states falls short in resolving the skeptical
	paradox because when one seens a white surface illuminated with red light,
	one is justified in taking the surface to be red, provided one has
	no reason to suspect the quality of the light.

Basis-relative safety

:   A belief cannot consitute knowledge if the believer might too
	easily have so believed on the same basis while his belief was
	false.

:   In order to know one must believe on a certain basis, possibly
	the null basis, where so believing on such a basis has a strong
	enough tendancy to be right.

-   Safety does not serve the skeptic as does sensitivity.
	-   Belief that one is not radically deceived is insnsitive,
		but a belief can be safe despite being insensitive.

### Why the dream scenario is special

-   Our line of reasoning is effect against the usual run of radical
	skeptical scenarious, such as BIV, EDD, and the Matrix.
	-   *Only the dream scenario stands apart.*
	-   Dreams are so common that the possibility one dreams is not
		outlandish.
		-   Therefore, I cannoy defend the safety of my belief that
			I am awake by adducing how remote is the possibility that
			I go wrong in so believing.

-   There are those who defend common sense against the sensitivity-
	weilding skeptic by rejecting closure.
	-   Even if we do not know ourselves to be free of radical scenarios,
		we can still know of hands and fires.
		-   This has very implausible consequences.

	-   And this strategy could not be used against the safety-weilding
		skeptic.
		-	He can use the dream scenario for a direct attack on ordinary
			perceptual beliefs.

	-   Take a belief that one sees a hand, or a fire.
		-   Too easily might one form such a belief on its usual
			experiential basis, while only dreaming.
		-   So it is not a safe belief.
		-   This does not depend on closure.

-   This is why the dream scenario has a distinctive important by comparision
	with the familiar radical scenarios.
	-   It is *not outlandish*
	-   It threatens our perceptual beliefs *directly*.
		-   "Not by way of closure."

-   That does require an orthodox conception of dreams.
	-   According to which, beliefs and experiences hosted not only
		in the dream but also in actuality, while we dream.
		-   *Only thus* would our ordinary perceptual beliefs be
			threatened by the possibility that we might same on the
			same experiential basis in a realistic dream.

>   Is that really how we should conceive of our dreams?

### Dreams: The orthodox conception

-   Are dreams made up of conscious states just like those of
	waking life?
	-   Orthodoxy: yes.
	-   Orthodoxy: Dream states and waking states are thought to
		be instrinsically alike though different in cause and effects.

-   This is highly flawed.

>   Dreams-based skepticism stands out because the dream possibility
>   is too close for comfort.

-   "Subjectively indistinguishable"
	-   Too easily we might have been dreaming.

-   Fortuntely, the orthodoxly is not beyond question.

### What are dreams made of?

-   Do the characters in our dreams have beliefs and intentions?
	-   They do *in general*, but do I myself also have them as
		protagonist in my dream?
		-   I do believe and intend things in my dream.
		-   In my dream I, ...
			1.  Am concious;
			2.  Assent to this or that.
			3.  I judge
			4.  I choose.

		-   But does this *really* happen?

-   When something happens in my dream, reality tends to not follow
	suit.
	-   When I am chased by a lion, it poses no threat to my skin.
	-   What is in question is the inference from (In my dream I believe
		such and such) to (In actuality I so believe such and such).

-   An automatic door opener *can register* and is an accurate gauge of the world
