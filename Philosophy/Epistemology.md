Epistemology <small>with Peter Klein</small>
============================================

September 4th, 2013 <small>The Gettier Problem</small>
------------------------------------------------------

> What's Gettier's main point?

-   JTB is not complete because there are cases where JTB isn't knowledge.
    -   JTB is not sufficient for knowledge.
    
-   What he's after is, ... how does he argue for it?
    -   One strategy he is uses is describing cases where you have
        justification and belief and (by accident) truth.
        >   Yeah, Jones/Smith has a JTB, but he does not have
        >   knowledge.
        
-   Two claims about justification:
>   1.   **The Closure Principle**
>        -   What does it mean for a set of objects to be closed?
>        -   Every member of the set is related to every other member?
>       
>   2.  **The K-thesis**
>       1.  Kp $\to$ KKP
>       2.  Kp $\to$ KKK ... Kp

-   To know that `p` is to know everything about the concepts of `p`.
    -   To know that `Kp` you probably need to have the concepts of `K`, "knowledge."
    -   Therefore, if you don't know about knowing you can't know (?).
    
-   Look at the simple justification closure principle.
    -   Counterexamples?
    
September 9th, 2013 <small>Reading, 'Knowledge Needs No Justification', Hilary Kornblith</small>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>   **The Standard View**, that knowledge is justified true belief
>   plus something else. JTB+

-   **Internalists** argue that a feature of belief in virtue
    of which it is justified must, in some sense, be internal
    to the person that holds it.
    -   **Externalists** deny this.
    
-   **Reliabalists** think that justification comes from reliable
    belief-forming processes, reliably leading to truth.
-   Goldman rejected justification in 'A Causal Theory of Knowing'.
    -   He has said little in writing about this.
    -   In "A Causal Theory of Knowing", Goldman argued that knowledge
		of p is nothing more than true belief caused by the fact
		that p.
		
### 2. Dialectical conceptions of justification

-   Justification is seen as a matter of the ability to present
	arguments in support of one's beliefs.
-   In the case of scientific communities, the ability to respond
	to arguments from one's community may be central to
	one's knowledge.
-   Note that not all communities are like this, for instance astrologers
	with tea leaves. 
	-   The scientific community is highly idiosyncratic.

-   If justification is identified with the ability to respond to
	socially available challenges, then justification is not a
	necessary condition for knowledge.
-   If justification is identified with the process of reflecting
	on one's beliefs, then justification is not a necessary
	condition for knowledge.

>   The dialectical conception of justification, whether in its social 
>   form-which requires an ability to justify one's beliefs to one's 
>   community-or in its more individualist form-which requires that 
>   one be in a position to justify one's beliefs to oneself, does 
>   not present us with a plausible necessary condition on knowledge.

### 3. Objective conceptions of justification

-   While objective standards for justification do not suffer from
	the same trouble of being arbitrary that dialectical ones do,
	Kornblith thinks that the more objective you make the standards,
	the less plausible it is that these standards of justification.
-   Consider probabilistic standards.
	-   It's widely implausible that any agent can compute the crazy
		complicated independent and dependent conjunctions and disjunctions
		of propositions and their probability.
	-   So it's a little weird to impose standards that are unachievable.

-   There will always be a gap between the *actual* reliability of a process
	and the *perceived* reliability of a process, and so this is no
	grounds for justicational objectivity.

### 4. Conclusion 

-   Failure to meet the standards of justification, either dialectical
	or objective, is evidence that one does not know.
	-   But it is *not* a necessary condition.

-   Failure to meet the standards for justification deprives one of knowledge
	even if justification is not a necessary condition for knowledge.
	-   Consider Jack, who has a lucky guess belief that is true
		which he thinks is knowledge.
	-   When ask to satisfy the standards of his community, he will
		be unable to and will give up on his knowledge claim.
	-   When made to satisfy his own standards, he will be unable to
		and thus no longer believe it.
	-   It's no longer knowledge.

September 9th, 2013 <small>1st Meeting on Kornblith</small>
-----------------------------------------------------------

-   Descartes thinks that knowledge needs to be indubitable. 
-   Moore says "he knows that he has a hand," and so if any theory
	attests he doesn't, it's a bad theory.
	-   It's because he knows that he has a hand more than he knows your
		theory of knowledge.

-   You can tether a belief to truth with justification.
	-   Gettier said this wasn't good enough because you can have a justified
		true belief that isn't knowledge.
		-   Gettier cases do not entail the proposition which is false.

-   Here are two ways of talking about justification.
	-   Defeasiblility theory.
	-   Reliabalism.

-   There are two ways of solving Gettier.
	-   Ramping up evidence.
	-   Add a causal condition.
	-   Neither challenge justification.

-   Kornblith shows that justification isn't a necessary condition of 
	knowledge, his formulation.
-   Read carefully footnote 24.

September 11th, 2013 <small>2nd Meeting on Kornblith</small>
------------------------------------------------------------

-   Starting with AJ Ayer and Alvin Goldman, what tied truth to
    belief was reliable process.
    -   You might offer as reasons for belief an absolutely terrible
        reason.
        -   You might still know it if the belief was formed by
            a reliable process.
    
    -   You might provide fallacious reasoning, but if the all
        the processes you used reliably produce truth, then
        you know.
    -   Here's a case where the traditions will come apart:
        -   Think of the gypsie fortune teller who can predict
            the winner of the horse race.
        -   And they can predict the next one. And the next one.
            And over and over again.
        -   They don't know that they can get it right, but they
            believe it.
        -   They think knowledge is a property that many other
            animals have.
        -   Knowledge is a representational state.
        -   The gypsie fortune-teller knows because the representation                
        -   Does that mean our epistemic evaluation of the fortune-teller
            and the horse-race-scientist with rational reasons has to be the same?
            Not better?

-   Supervinience is when a set of properties *A* supervenes on a set *B*
    if and only if a change in the set of *A* properties implies a change in 
    the set of *B* properties.
-   Types of justification
    -   Doxastic justification is the belief state of justification actualized.
        -   This is what reliabilists are interested in.
        
    -   Propositional justification is the belief state of justification potentially.

-   Arguements on paper or dialetical arguments
    -   Public (community)
        -   Epistemic communities
        -   Contextualism
        
    -   Private
        -   Cartesian
        -   Foley

September 16th, 2013 <small>3rd Meeting on Kornblith</small>
------------------------------------------------------------

-   Argument:
	1.  There are only *x* levels of justification.
	2.  None of the *x* levels of justification are necessary for knowledge.
	3.  Therefore, justification is not necessary for knowledge.

-   There are two forms of justification for Kornblith:
	1.  Objective.
	2.  Subjective, of which there are:
		1.  Public, of where there are:
			1.  Contextualist
			2.  Equal?

		2.  Private

-   Galileo had knowledge but did not satisfy the requirements of the community.
	-   Your community can have totally kooky reasons for believing what they do.
	-   So you can have knowledge without satisfying their requirements.

-   The contextualist account of justification.
	-   It's that the standards for justification vary based on context.
	-   Suppose I say, along with Keith DeRose and Stewart Cohen, has this example:
		-   Consider a case *A* where a husband and wife are driving their car and the
			husband said, "I'd like to deposit this cheque in the bank."
		-   "How is the bank open?"
		-   "It was open last Saturday, and I think I remember seeing a sign."
		-   The person knew, therefore? We count this as knowledge.
		-   Now suppose the same case, but Klein is the person who has to deposit
			the cheque and it is absolutely crucial that Klein get it in, otherwise
			Klein will lose his house, money, etc.
		-   It's important to see what contextualists mean, *S* **knows** that *p*.
			-   "Know" is **attributor relative**, where it is like "here", "now",
				"I", "we."
			-   Attributor relative something reflexive â€¦

	-   Suppose Klein has very high standards, close to the Cartesian, and he says
		that you don't know unless you can eliminate all standards for doubt.
		-   Hume says the only way to avoid doubts, ignore the doubts of philosophers.

-   Closure where *h* = "I have a hand."
	1.  If *S* knows that *h*, then *S* knows that there is no evil genius making
		*S* falsely believe that *h*.
		-   I disagree, because it is possible that *S* can know that *h* **and**
			*S* can falsely believe *h*. How? Because if the evil genius made
			*S* believe that *h* and *h* were actually true, it would be an
			instance of falsely believing despite being true. How? Because
			the belief that *h* would violate the norms of believing.
		-   I think this argument may be abusing "believing falsely" by
			making it seem like the only way to do that is to believe something
			that is false. I think it's confusing because of perspective.
			Replace "belief" with "know", perhaps?
		-   Yes. It is not necessarily true that if *S* knows that *h*, then
			*S* doesn't falsely believe, because what the consequent should be
			is falsely *know* that *h*.
	2.  *S* doesn't know that there is not an evil genius.
		-   This means you have to be able to defeat all other cases.
	3.  Therefore, *S* doesn't know that *h*.


September 18th, 2013 <small>Reading, 'Useful False Beliefs', Peter Klein</small>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Purpose: Examine the role of false beliefs in the production of knowledge.

### Key notions

1.  **Propositional** vs. **Doxastic** justification.
	-   Propositions are the contents of beliefs.
	-   *S* can be **propositionally justified** and not believe *p*.

2.  **Causal** and **evidential overdetermination**
	-   An event or state is *causally overdetermined* if and only if
		it has at least two actual causes of which, in the actual 
		circumstances, acted as a sufficient cause to produce the
		state or event.
	-   A proposition *p* is *evidentially overdetermined* for *S*
		if and only if there exists at least two independent bases
		available for *S* each of which is sufficient to propositionally
		justify *p*.

		$$ E(S) \iff \exists e_1 e_2 ( J_S p ) \land e_1 \neq e_2 $$ 

3.  **Knowledge**
	-   *S*'s doxastically justified, true belief falls short of being
		knowledge if *S* felicitously acquired the true belief on the basis
		of part of the relevant evidence when some other part of the
		evidence, if combined with the evidence *S* did acquire, defeats
		the justification.
	-   *S* inferentially knows that *h* if and only if:
		1.  *h* is true;
		2.  *S* believes that *h*;
		3.  *S*'s belief that *h* is inferred from and doxastically 
			justified by another belief, say the belief that *e*,
			which is doxastically justified.
		4.  There is no genuine defeater of the propositional justification
			of any of the propositions in the evidential path up to and
			including *e*, and there is no genuine defeater of the
			propositional justification of any proposition between *e*
			and *h*.

### A review of Gettier

-   Two Gettier principles:

>   III. Fallibilism: A person, *S*, can be doxastically justified in
>   believing a proposition, *p*, and *p* can be false.
>   
>   IV. Closure: If a person, *S*, is doxastically justified in 
>   believing a proposition, *p*, and *p* entails *q*, and *S* comes
>   to believe that *q* on the basis of deducing it from *p*, then
>   *S* is doxastically justified in believing that *p*.

### Examples and prelimnary discussion of useful falsehoods

1.  The Appointment Case
	-   Klein believes that his secretary told him on Friday that he
		has an appointment with a student on Monday.
	-   Klein *does* have an appointment with his student on Monday.
	-   His secretary told him on Thursday, however.
	-   There is an available, undefeated, propositional evidential
		chain for the belief that Klein has an appointment on Monday,
		but Klein took an evidential path which contained a false
		proposition.

2.  The Santa Claus Case
	-   Mom and Dad tell Virginia that Santa will put presents under the
		tree.
	-   She infers that there will be presents under the tree.
	-   There will be presents under the tree. The intuition is
		that, therefore, she knows!

3.  The Average Rainfall Case
	-   Weatherman believes that the average annual precipitation in
		Northwest Montana is about 13 inches.
	-   He believes this on the grounds that there have been accurate
		records for over 80 years, and 13 inches is what they say.
	-   The average rainfall *is* 13 inches, but records have only
		been kept for 79 years.
	-   He knows.

4.  The Ptolemaic Astronomer Case
	-   In Oxford University in astronomy class, the best Ptolemaic 
		astronomer taught students to calculate the relative positions
		of planets with the Ptolemaic model.
	-   The Professor asks students whether Mars will be visible in
		800 years from now, assuming Mars and Earth exist and visibility
		is good.
	-   The students accurately determine whether Mars will be visible,
		say the answer is yes.
	-   They know.

### The proposed characterization of useful falsehoods

-   The belief that *uf* is a useful falsehood to *S* for acquiring
	knowledge that *h* by producing a doxastically justified belief
	that *h* if and only if:
	1.  *uf* is false;
		-   Analytically required that *uf* must be false.

	2.  The belief that *uf* is doxastically justified for *S*;
		-   An instance of the general requirement that doxastic 
			justification which depends on another beliefs requires that
			belief to be doxastically justified.

	3.  The belief that *uf* is essential in the causal production
		of the belief that *h*;
		-   Analytically contained in the notion of a *useful* falsehood
			that justifies *h*, since such falsehoods, unlike the so-called
			harmless ones, are essential in producing doxastically
			justified beliefs.

	4.  *uf* propositionally justifies *h*;
		-   Follows from the general account of doxastic justification
			given earlier. One consequence of that account is that, if
			the belief that *uf* doxastically justifies the belief that 
			*h*, then *uf* propositionally justifies *h*.

	5.  *uf* entails a true proposition *t*;
	6.  *t* propositionally justified *h*;
		-   This might look redundant, but it isn't because it isn't
			necessarily true for all cases, isn't generally true
			about justification.

	7.  Whatever doxastically justifies the belief that *uf* for *S*
		also propositionally justified *t* for *S*.

September 18th, 2013 <small>1st Meeting on Klein</small>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Some background

-   What most people think Gettier showed was that JTB was not
	*sufficient* for knowledge, not that they were not *necessary*.
	-   A lot of people thought that this may mean there is another
		condition, and the first attempt was **evidentialism**.
	-   The way that epistemologists initially attempted to solve this
		way by beefing up the justification condition.
	-   The recipe is find a false belief your justified in, find a
		true proposition that it entails, using closure.
		-   This belief will be true and justified which you believe
			on the basis of the deduction from a false justified belief.

-   Clark grants that JTB is not sufficient, and the way that he solves
	the Gettier problem is by saying the proposition that you use
	as evidence must be a JTB for you.
	-   If you get to the evidence or belief by chains of inference,
		they must all be true.
	-   It must be **fully-grounded**, if there is something false
		in there, it will be "lucky break" that you had a JTB.
	-   This is the first evidentialist approach.

### Evidentialism

-   **Disjunctive normal form**: $\lbrace a, b, c, d ... x \rbrace$:

	$$\exists x F(x) \equiv F(a) \lor F(b) \lor F(c) \lor ... $$  

-   Michael Clark came up with a case where you have justified,
	true, belief that whose basis is good and you *still* do not
	have knowledge.
	-   Klein comes to believe that Ben owns a Ford.
	-   As it turns out, Ben stole the Ford.
	-   He has a valid-looking title, and there's testimony
		that he bought it, etc.
	-   Klein comes to believe that someone in the class owns
		a Ford on the basis that Ben owns a Ford.
	-   As it turns out, someone does own a Ford in the class,
		but clearly not Ben.
	-   Imagine that Klein is epistemically careful, a careful
		reasoner. He notes that it's more likely that someone
		owns a Ford, and that the belief is less likely to be wrong,
		less risky.
		-   This clever reasoner did not make use of any false belief.

-   Consider another case: Klein has good evidence that Ben and Sherri
	own a Ford. Ben does not, Sherri does. Klein believes on these grounds
	that "someone owns a Ford."
	-   This is **epistemically overdetermined**, having two ways to get
		to the same belief, one false, one true, and still knowledge.

-   You can *always* fix a theory which is supposedly defeated by a counterexample
	by just ad-hoc ruling out the counter-example. But it's just that, it's *ad-hoc*.
	-   So evidentialism was supposed to not work (for now).

### Defeasibility

-   Many people think that **defeasibility theory** is part of
	the evidentialist tradition.
	-   The expression "defeasibility" comes from ethics.

-   Say *E* is the set of all evidence, for and against, a proposition *p*.
-   *e* is the set of evidence which justifies *S* in believing *p*. Notation:
	$$e J_S p$$

-   A good definition takes the cases where almost it's almost
	universally thought someone has knowledge and validates it,
	where it's almost universally thought someone doesn't and
	validates it, and where it's almost universally vague and
	clarifies it and why it's vague.

### Reliablism

-   There can be misleading evidence, so defeasibility eliminates
	too much.
	-   The simple defensibility theory isn't good, that, looks
		too strong.
	-   Many people thought that defeasibility didn't work.
	-   There was an alternatively available, which fit really
		nicely with naturalized epistemology.

-   Some people think that if you want to know what knowledge is,
	you shouldn't sit in your EZ chair and thinking about.
	-   Just like if you want to figure out what gold is, you
		go study gold things.
	-   If you want to study knowledge, go become a cognitive 
		scientist or psychologist.
	-   Knowledge is the end of a process, *go and study the process*!

-   The first shot was Alvin Goldman's paper, 'A Causal Theory of Knowledge.'
	-   Knowledge happens in the brain, in the mind.
	-   Knowledge, therefore, has a certain causal genealogy.
	-   The object has to be in the causal history of the belief.
	-   Suppose I look outside the window and I believe there will be
		rain in ten minutes. That belief cannot be caused by the rain in the
		ten minutes because the causal chain isn't temporally there yet.

-   Sometimes this is called internalist, where evidentialists and defeasibility theorists
	are called externalists.
-   Barn facade case:
	-   Supose you're going through phony barn country.
	-   A hurricane has come through upper Vermont, but people
		come for the barns.
	-   The tourist agency think that this will destroy the industry,
		so they put up facades.
	-   You're going through the country, and you see the *1* real barn.
	-   The barn is appropriately caused, it's justified true belief, but
		the intuition is that it is not knowledge.
	
September 23rd, 2013 <small>2nd Meeting on Klein</small>
--------------------------------------------------------

-   The recipe for Gettier cases is having a false, justified that
	entails a true belief, and you have an accident!
	-   The general view is that Gettier basically shows that there
		cannot be a useful falsehood.
	-   The way you work out what is essential evidence is dropping
		it from the set of evidence justifying a belief, and if it
		no longer justifies the belief, it was essential. If it still
		justifies, it's a harmless falsehoods.

-   You are entitled to believe a proposition if and only if you believe
	the proposition on the grounds of the propositions which reliably
	get that proposition on the grounds of the evidence.
	-   You're doxasticly entitled to a belief if the propositional
		evidence justifies you.

September 25th, 2013 <small>3rd Meeting on Klein</small>
--------------------------------------------------------

-   The initial response to the Gettier literature was the
	**no false grounds** view, where every justifier cannot
	be false.
	-   This will not be enough because of the clever reasoner
		knows that "someone owns a Ford" from "Nogot owns a Ford",
		and as it turns out "Havit owns a Ford" and Havit is
		someone.
		-   False grounds, true justified belief, knowledge.
		-   The clever reasoner is careful and is less likely to be
			wrong with the someone clause.
		-   This gets rid of this conditions necessity. 

	-   Cases of epistemic overdetermination will show that it isn't
		even sufficient. 

-   Most foundationalists who are reliablists think that there are
	basic proposition and beliefs which justify all other propositions
	and beliefs.
-   An essential falsehood is when if you remove it, you can no longer
	be justified in believing truth.
-   If you're stuck on a long paper and you've found an objection,
	instead of giving up on the paper, just counter it and clench
	victory from the jaws of the philosophical community.
-   The problem of useful falsehoods is a problem for evidentialists,
	defeasibility theorists, *and* reliablists.
	-   The generality problem for reliablists is an instance of
		many different processes.
		-   For reliablists, they have to say that useful falsehoods
			are part of a reliable process, whereas harmful falsehoods
			are not. So there's a way out!

	-   For defeasibility, there is the distinction between genuine
		and misleading defeaters *a la* Grabit and Grabit's brother.

September 30th, 2013 <small>Reading, 'Immediate Justification and Process Reliablism', Alvin Goldman</small>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

-   Is there a species of prima facie justification that is
	immediate, direct, basic, or foundational?
	-   It is puzzling whether and how immediate justification
		could arise.
	-   This is the *core issue* for foundationalists and 
		coherentists.
	-   An older conception is that some beliefs are 
		**self-justifying**, that they do not need anything *else*
		to justify them but themselves.
		-   This is no longer very popular.

-   In general, there are justifying factors that are **doxastic**
	and **propositional**, where propositional does not presuppose
	that the agent actually believe the target justifying factor
	and doxastic *does*.
-   There are three central questions:
	1.  Is there a species of justification that is immediate, direct,
		or basic?
		-   Are some beliefs made justified in virtue of states of
			affairs or processes that confer justification
			without *themselves* being justified?

	2.  If yes, how is immediate justification conferral possible?
		-   What is wrong with the arguments *against* unjustified
			justifiers.

	3.  Assuming that these arguments are invalid, what types
		of states or processes can serve as immediate justification?

-   Must the unjustified justifiers themselves be contentful?
	Three possible answers:
	1.  Immediate justifiers are contentful for the agent.
	2.  Immediate justifiers are non-contentful.
	3.  They can be either.

### Feldman's proposal <small>A proper response to experience</small>

>   Being spontaneously formed makes a belief 
>   immediately justified.

-   This is quickly rejected with an alternative with an addendum of
	"proper response to experience"

>   A spontaneously formed belief is justified provided
>   it is a proper response to experience and is not defeated
>   by other evidence the believer has.

September 30th, 2013 <small>1st Meeting on Goldman</small>
-----------------------------------------------------

-   Suppose there is some belief Bp.
	-   "Belief is true" -> propositional content
	-   "She had the belief" -> belief state
	-   "Justified belief"
		-   Could mean the *believing* is justified. "You're not justified
			to that *state*"
		-   The content of the state, "You don't have good enough evidence"
			or "You have good evidence but there's this opposing view."

-   When Goldman talks about coherentism,
	-   You could talk about self-justified beliefs
	-   If you're familiar with Aristotle you'll see
		the epistemic regress is part of a lot of
		regresses that Aristotle wanted to avoid.

-   What is the traditional view? *Crude* Aristotle.
	-   Suppose you say, here's a substance. It can have
		two types of properties:
		1.  Essential properties, it is necessary that
			the substance have this property. If it loses
			it, it is no longer that substance.
		2.  Accidental properties, it acquires and loses
			this property.

-   Coherentism
	-   Bad form, circular reasoning
	-   Better form

October 9th, 2013 <small>2nd Meeting on Conee & Feldman</small>

-   Suppose you're driving along, and you see what you take to
	be what is someone walking through a brick wall.
	-   Well, you're *prima facie* justified in believing that
		that person is walking through the wall, but you're
		not going to think you have *ultima facie* justification.
	-   It can be quickly overruled.

-   There are **direct realists** and **indirect realists**
	-   *Direct realists* think that the basic propositions
		in foundational justification are states of affairs,
		-   "There are tables."
		-   Claim about physical objects.

	-   *Indirect realists*
		-   Direct, non-inferential knowledge of objects.
		-   I'm not just aware of ideas, I can infer there
			are physical objects with constant properties.

	-   *Idealists*
		-   This is not "'ideal'-ist", it is "'idea'-ist."
		-   The only things that exists are ideas and collections
			of ideas.

-   If you think of a mind of something like a room where all
	we see is something like images on the wall, like Plato's
	cave, I *could* infer that these correspond to non
	mind-independent, but I do not necessarily. 
	-   How do I get *out of mind*?

-   What Huemer thinks is that if I am having a phenomenal
	experience, then I am entitled to the belief, and the
	belief is knowledge if the proposition is not overridden
	by other knowledge I have.
	-   So this is where there is *prima facie*, "non-overriden."
	-   And then there is *ultima facie*, "undefeated."

-   Goldman is saying that there is the belief, "I have a pain."
	-   Most people have taken this type of belief to be a basic
		belief.
	-   If they're like Huemer, also tables, because there are
		basic beliefs about the world and about internal
		mental states.
		-   If indirect realism is correct there has to be a
			seeming that there is a pain distinct from having
			a pain.

-   Suppose you are just terrible at distinguishing a tickle
	from a pain, then you would, in some sense, could be wrong
	about *how it seems to you*.
	-   You're just terrible at classifying pains.
	-   It's propositional *enough* in the sense that you could
		say it about the seemings for the person going through
		the wall.
		-   I'm not sure if you should categorize that as going
			through a wall or as a person.

	-   There are people that believe they have pains that do not,
		psychological problems, etc.

-   Foundationalists think that there is a causal chain from basic
	beliefs to more complex beliefs.
	-   They will try to explain how the belief is caused by
		evidence, or "the proposition."
	-   Suppose I believe something on basis of bad evidence, I do
		not know it. Suppose I come to believe it on good evidence,
		does the citing reasons and justification make you 
		doxastically justifiers.

-   Decisions made by the Senate **supervene** on the votes of
	individual Senators.
